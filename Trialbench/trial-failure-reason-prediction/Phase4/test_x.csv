      For patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, light sedation is better than deep sedation
      for the outcomes, which is manifested as shortened length of ICU stay, shortened duration of
      mechanical ventilation, and decreased mortality. In a recent study of the investigators,
      low-dose dexmedetomidine without sedative effects (0.1 ug/kg/h) improved sleep quality and
      reduced the incidence of delirium in elderly patients admitted to the ICU after surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that, for ICU patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation,
      low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion (0.1 ug/kg/h) may also be effective in decreasing delirium.
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion can
      reduce the incidence of delirium in ICU patients with prolonged duration of mechanical
      ventilation (>= 24 hours).
    ",Low-dose Dexmedetomidine in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients,"['Adult Disease', 'Intensive Care Unit Syndrome', 'Mechanical Ventilation Complication', 'Delirium', 'Dexmedetomidine']",Delirium,"
      Delirium is an acutely occurred and transient brain dysfunction characterized with cognitive
      dysfunction, lowered consciousness, disturbed attention, abnormal psychoactivity, and
      disordered sleep-wake rhythm. Delirium is frequent in mechanically ventilated patients in the
      intensive care unit (ICU), with reported incidences up to 70% or 87%. Possible reasons
      leading to delirium include the intervention-heavy environment of the ICU, mechanical
      ventilation and sleep disturbances. The occurrence of delirium is associated with worse
      outcomes including prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, increased complications,
      prolonged hospital stay, higher mortality, and elevated medical expenses. It is also
      associated with worse long-term outcomes including declined cognitive function, lowered life
      quality, and elevated long-term mortality.

      Dexmedetomidine is a high selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist with anxiolytic, sedative
      and analgesic effects. When used for sedation in mechanically ventilated patients (dose range
      0.2-1.4 ug/kg/h), it reduces the consumption of other sedatives and analgesics, ameliorates
      the rhythm and structure of sleep, and decreases the occurrence of delirium. In recent
      studies of the investigators, low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion (0.1 ug/kg/h) ameliorated
      sleep quality; for elderly patients admitted to the ICU after surgery, prophylactic low-dose
      dexmedetomidine infusion reduced the incidence of delirium (for patients with mechanical
      ventilation: 28.8% with placebo vs. 11.5% with dexmedetomidine, P<0.0001; for patients
      without mechanical ventilation: 15.1% with placebo vs. 6.3% with dexmedetomidine, P=0.014).

      For patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, light sedation is better than deep sedation
      for the outcomes, which is manifested as shortened length of ICU stay, shortened duration of
      mechanical ventilation, and decreased mortality. Some authors even reported that no sedation
      (analgesia only) provides better outcome than light sedation, because it further shortens the
      durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. In the above studies of the investigators,
      the recruited patients were less severe because the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
      Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was low (mean score from 10.2 to 10.6) and the duration of
      mechanical ventilation was short (median 6.9 hours in the control group). The investigators
      hypothesize that, for ICU patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation, low-dose
      dexmedetomidine infusion (0.1 ug/kg/h) may also be effective in improving sleep and
      decreasing delirium. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose
      dexmedetomidine infusion can reduce the incidence of delirium in ICU patients with prolonged
      duration of mechanical ventilation (>= 24 hours).

      Surgical repair of hip fractures may be performed with various anesthetic techniques, but are
      most commonly completed under general anesthesia (GA) or neuraxial anesthesia (NA). Numerous
      prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate improved morbidity and mortality when NA is
      used; however, many surgeons prefer the use of GA with neuromuscular blockade (NMB) due to
      the perception of better operative conditions. This study aims to compare the operative
      conditions obtained from the use of combined GA and spinal with NMB vs. the use of GA with
      spinal without NMB. 84 patients will all receive a single shot spinal and GA and then will be

      and then sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, and ketamine as necessary per standard practice to
      facilitate lateral positioning. Patients will be positioned with the operative side down for
      the spinal blockade. Under sterile conditions, spinal anesthesia will be induced with 10mg
      (1.2mL) of hyperbaric 0.75% bupivicaine as per standard practice. The patient will then be
      given a standard general anesthetic induction consisting of propofol, succinylcholine,
      fentanyl, and lidocaine. The patient will be intubated and anesthesia will be maintained with
      desflurane in oxygen and air. At the time of incision, the patient will be randomized to one
      of two groups. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist will be blinded to the patient's
      randomization status. Group 1 (NMB) will be given IV rocuronium 0.6mg/kg in a volume of 10cc.
      Group 2 (placebo) will be given 10cc normal saline. The anesthesia practitioner will test a
      Train of Four (TOF) and confirm a return of twitches prior to administering the study
      intervention. The nerve stimulator will then be disconnected until the conclusion of the
      case. Hemodynamic changes which suggest light anesthesia will be treated with additional
      fentanyl in 50mcg increments and/or increasing the desflurane concentration. Any hypotension
      directly attributed to the anesthetic by the anesthetic practitioner will be managed using a
      phenylephrine bolus and/or infusion as per standard anesthetic practice. Surgery will be
      performed by one of three fellowship trained orthopedic trauma surgeons, and fixation of
      these fractures will be with a single type of cephalomedullary implant (Synthes TFN-A, West
      Chester, PA). These three surgeons employ an identical bed, patient position, and traction
      technique (sterile skeletal traction) for these procedures. A percutaneous reduction will
      first be attempted. If unsuccessful, an open reduction will then be pursued. Following
      adequate reduction, fixation with the cephalomedullary implant will then be completed. Once
      skin closure has been initiated, to reverse any NMB, sugammadex 200mg in 2ml will be given to
      those patients randomized to the NMB group, and 2mL normal saline for the placebo group. At
      the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, a nerve stimulator may be reapplied not
      less than 5 minutes after NMB reversal (or saline) is given. Once the attending surgeon has
      evaluated the final radiographs, all patients will have their anesthetics discontinued and
      will be extubated after emergence from anesthesia.

      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common and continue to be persistent problems
      following general anesthesia. Intranasal lidocaine has been used for the treatment of
      migraine. The theoretical basis for this effect of intranasal lidocaine on migraine relief is
      reported to be due to its action on the sodium receptors within the sphenopalatine ganglion.
      Although there is no reported association between PONV and migraines, injecting lidocaine
      within the sphenopalatine ganglion has proven to be effective in reducing PONV in endoscopic

      lidocaine in preventing PONV.
    ",Intranasal Lidocaine for Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting.,Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting,"['Nausea', 'Vomiting', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting']","
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication following general
      anesthesia.[1] In the absence of prophylaxis, it can occur in greater than one third of the
      patients undergoing surgery, and the incidence is even higher in patients with predisposing
      risk factors.[2] Surgical procedures that have been shown to be associated with a high
      incidence of PONV include breast, gynecologic, abdominal, and thyroid surgeries.[3-5]
      Although PONV usually resolves with treatment, its occurrence can increase postoperative
      morbidity, increase hospital cost, and prolong hospital length of stay.[1-6]Despite numerous
      available prophylactic treatments and proposed strategies, the incidence of PONV continue to
      be high given its complex pathogenesis.[1]

      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and its intravenous administration has been used as an
      adjuvant for the treatment of postoperative pain.[7] Intranasal lidocaine has also been used
      for the treatment of pain, specifically migraine, with significant relief of nausea.[8] The
      theoretical basis for this effect of intranasal lidocaine on migraine relief is reported to
      be due to its action on the sodium receptors within the sphenopalatine ganglion.[9] Although
      there is no reported association between PONV and migraines, injecting lidocaine within the
      sphenopalatine ganglion has proven to be effective in reducing PONV in patients undergoing
      endoscopic sinus surgery.[10]

      Due to the complex mechanism of PONV, proven benefits of lidocaine on pain and possibly
      nausea, and previously shown benefit of sphenopalatine block in reducing PONV, we hypothesize
      that intranasal lidocaine could provide effective prophylaxis for PONV.

      This study evaluates the effect of micronized progesterone substitution in the luteal phase
      on resting energy expenditure in women during menopausal transition.
    ",Progesterone and Resting Energy Expenditure,"['Menopause', 'Progesterone', 'Weight Gain']",Weight Gain,"
      The majority of women report an increase of body weight of about 0.5 kg/year during the
      menopausal transition. However, the weight gain has not been attributed to menopause itself
      but rather to, e.g., a decrease of the basal metabolic rate due to aging, less energy
      expenditure and a non-adapted caloric intake.

      One of the first signs of the menopausal transition is a change in the bleeding pattern due
      to a disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary-axis. The number of cycles with an
      insufficient luteal phase and anovulatory cycles with an insufficient or even absent luteal
      phase increase as the menopausal transition proceeds. Thus, in perimenopausal women
      progesterone endogenous exposure decreases in quantity and duration. By substituting
      progesterone during the luteal phase, irregular cycle and bleeding patterns can be
      normalized. However, besides the beneficial effects of progesterone on the course of a
      menstrual cycle it displays some features that may be preventive for weight gain.

      In this study only women in their early menopausal transition with menstrual cycle
      irregularities are included. By substituting progesterone during luteal phase the
      investigator tries to normalize their menstrual cycle pattern. The hypothesis is, that
      progesterone might not only normalize the menstrual cycle pattern of women in their early
      menopausal transition but due to its metabolic activities, progesterone may also increase the
      resting energy expenditure and thus may prevent weight gain during the menopausal transition.
      Furthermore the effect of progesterone substitution on the expression of miRNAs which are
      included in glucose- and lipid-metabolism such as miR-370 and miR-29 will be investigated.

      The purpose of this study is to compare pain control during vulvar biopsy following either
      (1) application of EMLA (a eutectic mixture of local anesthetics lidocaine 2.5% and
      prilocaine 2.5%) cream or (2) injection of 1% lidocaine. We hypothesize that lidocaine will
      provide better biopsy analgesia, but the benefit will be offset by the pain of lidocaine
      injection compared to EMLA application, thus there will not be a significant difference in
      highest pain scores between the two groups.
    ",Pain Perception During Vulvar Biopsy,Any Condition Requiring Vulvar Biopsy,,"
      Performing minor procedures in-office is essential to gynecologic practices. In-office
      procedures allow for evaluation and diagnosis of a variety of conditions while avoiding the
      expense, anesthesia, and time associated with the operating room. Pain and discomfort are
      frequently associated with these procedures, and ensuring that the patient has the least
      amount of discomfort is a priority. Very painful or uncomfortable procedures could
      potentially discourage a patient from returning to clinic or receiving the follow up that
      they may need. Psychological, physiologic, and social factors influence a patient's
      experience of pain. Previous studies, though mostly related to first trimester abortion
      procedures in the office, indicate that the procedure type, anxiety, depression, and general
      anticipation of pain predict increased pain during in office gynecologic procedures (1-4). A
      review by Ireland et al., found that a multimodal approach that includes patient counseling
      with other techniques is most effective in achieving optimum pain control for procedures
      (5,6).

      Vulvar biopsies are associated with significant discomfort, and some form of anesthesia is
      required. The current standard in our group is to inject local anesthesia prior to vulvar
      biopsy. However, the injection itself is associated with its own level of pain that is not
      insignificant, and for many, the anticipation of receiving an injection is anxiety provoking.
      The use of topical anesthesia in lieu of injection or as pre-injection analgesia is variable.

      Several previous studies have examined the use of topical anesthetics in the place of or in
      addition to injected anesthesia. Drouault et al. compared EMLA cream alone to injected
      lidocaine alone for pain relief in vulvar biopsy and found that pain associated with
      administration of anesthesia was significantly less for EMLA cream, but better biopsy
      analgesia was obtained with injected anesthesia. The study considered combined pain scores
      for both groups for the overall procedure (anesthesia + biopsy), it comments that the
      combined scores were lower for the EMLA group but failed to reach statistical significance.
      The study ultimately concluded that EMLA is the less painful procedure to obtain anesthesia
      and that it can be used as an alternative to injection for biopsies of the genital mucosa
      (7). This prior study did not compare the highest pain score between groups. Consideration of
      the highest pain score allows us to assess whether the injection of lidocaine could result in
      causing more pain than the biopsy itself using EMLA cream alone for anesthesia. Further, the
      study did not assess the subjects' or the providers' perception of the tolerability and
      acceptability of performing the procedure using either method. This is an important factor in
      any in office procedure

      EMLA cream is the most extensively studied topical anesthetic. It is FDA approved for use as
      a topical anesthetic on the genital mucous membranes for superficial, minor surgery. EMLA
      cream requires between 7-10 minutes of absorption time on the genital mucosa for analgesic
      effect, with variable duration of analgesia following, usually around 15-20 minutes (9).
      There is a highly variable absorption rate for EMLA cream depending on the characteristics of
      the epithelium upon which it is applied as well as the duration and surface area of cream
      applied. On hair-bearing non-mucosal surfaces it can require 60 minutes of application time
      to obtain analgesic affect (10). The vulvar area is unique in that it contains both mucosal
      and non-mucosal and hair-bearing surfaces; this could greatly affect the absorption of EMLA
      and therefore affect analgesia. For this reason, we will exclude from the study patients
      requiring vulvar biopsy on hair bearing portion of the vulva.

      Several previous studies have examined the use of topical anesthetics in the place of or in
      addition to injected anesthesia. Drouault et al. compared EMLA cream to injected lidocaine as
      described above. The study found that pain associated with administration of anesthesia was
      significantly less for EMLA cream, but better biopsy analgesia was obtained with injected
      anesthesia. However, there were some limitations to this study also noted above, that we plan
      to expand and improve upon with the current study.

      Zilbert and Lewandoswki studied pre-treatment with EMLA cream prior to anesthesia injection
      and found that pain was decreased by 50% in patients pretreated compared to placebo prior to
      lidocaine injection.

      Van den Berg studied application of EMLA alone versus lidocaine injection alone in punch
      biopsies and electrocoagulation of genital warts in men. The study found that in the punch
      biopsy cohort that the total pain scores (application of EMLA + biopsy versus injection of
      lidocaine + biopsy) were less for the EMLA group than the injected lidocaine group and the
      difference was statistically significant (11).

      With its FDA approval for use as a topical anesthetic on the genital mucous membranes for
      superficial, minor surgery, it can be considered a standard of care to use EMLA for
      anesthesia prior to biopsy as an alternative to injection of lidocaine (10)

      As there are no studies that consider the subjects' or the providers' perception of the
      acceptability or the tolerability of the procedure, this will be novel data for vulvar
      biopsy. However, acceptability and tolerability have been assessed in other procedural
      settings, such as in office endoscopic procedures, in which BS-11, a validated 11 point
      scale, is used to assess pain, anxiety, acceptability, tolerability, and levels of other
      procedure related symptoms (12-13).

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of four months of pioglitazone
      vs. metformin treatment on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, insulin
      resistance, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, adipokines, oxidative stress, and blood
      biomarkers of endothelial activation in obese insulin resistant children. 30 obese children
      with elevated fasting insulin levels will be randomly assigned to pioglitazone or metformin
      for 16 weeks. Change in clinical variables over the 16-week study period will be compared
      between groups.
    ","Pioglitazone Therapy in Obese Children With Insulin Resistance: A Randomized, Controlled Pilot Study","['Obesity', 'Insulin Resistance']",Insulin Resistance,"
      Background and Specific Aim/Hypothesis Obese, insulin resistant children are at increased
      risk of future cardiovascular disease due to elevated systolic blood pressure, fasting
      insulin, triglycerides, inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduced HDL cholesterol.
      Behavioral/lifestyle therapy should be the foundational approach to treating obesity and
      insulin resistance in all individuals, especially children. However, some children may need
      concomitant medical therapy in order to adequately address their severe risk factor profile
      and early vascular abnormalities. Although not approved by the FDA, metformin has been used
      with mixed success to treat obesity-associated cardiometabolic risk factors in children with
      evidence of insulin resistance. Clearly, other drug therapies should be explored to treat
      cardiovascular risk factors in obese, insulin resistant children.

      Thiazolidinediones have been used to improve glucose control in adult patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus for approximately 10 years. These peroxisome proliferator activated
      receptor agonists are unique among anti-diabetic agents in that they regulate gene
      transcription to improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (predominately skeletal
      muscle and adipose tissue). In addition to improving glycemic control, these drugs also
      improve multiple cardiometabolic risk factors such as lipoprotein profile, blood pressure,
      inflammatory markers, adipokines, and endothelial function. Despite the substantial body of
      data showing benefit in adults, pioglitazone has never been evaluated as a therapy to improve
      the cardiometabolic risk factor profile in obese children with evidence of insulin
      resistance.

      Specific Aim: To examine the effects of four months of pioglitazone vs. metformin treatment
      on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, insulin resistance, endothelial function,
      arterial stiffness, adipokines, oxidative stress, and blood biomarkers of endothelial
      activation in obese, insulin resistant children.

      Hypothesis: In the context of background behavioral therapy, four months of pioglitazone vs.
      metformin treatment will significantly improve HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood
      pressure, insulin resistance, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, adipokines, oxidative
      stress, and blood biomarkers of endothelial activation in obese insulin resistant children.

      Significance There is a substantial lack of data in the literature concerning potential drug
      therapies for reducing risk factors in children at high risk of developing future
      cardiovascular disease. Since the prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance in children
      has increased dramatically in the last several decades, there is an urgent need for data from
      randomized, controlled trials to guide treatment approaches for high risk children. This
      pilot study will result in the acquisition of valuable preliminary data which will be used to
      seek funding for and conduct a larger scale clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of
      pioglitazone for treating cardiometabolic risk factors in obese, insulin resistant children.

      Methods Patient Population: 30 obese, hyperinsulinemic children and adolescents entering a
      Pediatric Weight Management Program at the University of Minnesota will be enrolled. In this
      program, children and their families work with a team of trained professionals including
      physicians, dieticians, and psychologists to reduce weight by making healthier eating choices
      and increasing physical activity.

      Study Design: This will be a randomized, double-blind, active-comparator clinical trial.
      Variables will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization) and after four months of
      therapy.

      Data Collection: The screening visit will take place in the Pediatric Weight Management
      Clinic and will include a complete medical history and physical examination. All research
      testing will take place in the University of Minnesota General Clinical Research Center
      (GCRC).

      Statistical Analysis and Power Considerations: Randomization will be stratified by gender and
      Tanner stage. Changes between groups over time will be compared with a 2X2 (group by time)
      repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests. The main analysis of interest will be
      the ANOVA interaction term, which compares the change in variables over time (pre vs. post)
      between groups. The purpose of this study will be to obtain preliminary data to design and
      seek funding for a larger clinical trial.

      -  The main purpose of this study is to learn if incorporating a loop diuretic such as
           furosemide along with labetalol in the routine management of postpartum gestational
           hypertensive disorders could lower the need for additional anti-hypertensive agents to
           control blood pressures, improve blood pressures (as measured by systolic blood
           pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressures), shorten hospital
           stays and decrease readmissions for patients with gestational hypertensive disorders.

        -  Based on a study by Veena et al1, there is reason to believe that the addition of
           furosemide to other anti-hypertensives may help decrease the need to add or increase the
           dose of medication to control blood pressures. There may be potential to shorten
           hospital stays and decrease readmissions, as well. Collecting data will be done using a
           prospective, randomized 1:1 controlled study assigning postpartum patients with a
           gestational hypertensive diagnosis to either labetalol alone or labetalol plus
           furosemide.

        -  The study will be performed in the postpartum wing of Miami Valley Hospital Main Campus
           and would use patients who have consented to participate in the study with enrollees
           coming from the OB Staff population.

      Background and Literature Review

        -  There have been four documented studies investigating loop diuretics in the management
           of postpartum hypertensive disorders- Matthews et al2, Ascarelli et al3, Amorim et al4,
           and Veena et al. Of these studies, only Amorim and Veena were able to show statistical
           significance on any parameters. Amorim was able to show that there was an improvement of
           SBP, DBP and MAP, but the research was only presented as an abstract at a conference and
           not published, thereby making it impossible to draw any conclusions or practice
           guidelines. Veena demonstrated that by using furosemide and nifedipine in combination,
           the need for additional antihypertensive medication in severe pre-eclampsia in the
           postpartum period was reduced when compared to nifedipine alone.

        -  A systematic review5 of postpartum hypertensive disorder management suggested that there
           was insufficient data to recommend any single pharmacological intervention at this time
           in the management of gestational hypertensive disorders. The review emphasized the need
           for further studies to be conducted to help guide management of patients affected by
           gestational hypertensive disorders in the future.

      Objectives

      ● Main Question

        -  Does the use of furosemide plus labetalol improve blood pressures in the postpartum
           period of patients with gestational hypertensive disorders versus labetalol alone?

        -  Primary

           ■ Will there be a requirement to escalate antihypertensive therapy to control blood
           pressures

        -  Secondary

             -  Improvement of gestational hypertensive disorders by measurement of systolic blood
                pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure

             -  Shortened hospital stay in patients with hypertensive disorders

             -  Breastfeeding status at 1 week postpartum visit in mothers planning to breastfeed

             -  Readmission for postpartum hypertensive disorders

      Significance to patient, institution, and profession

        -  As a referral center and being the region's leader, Miami Valley is very accustomed to
           accepting transfers of high acuity patients often times with hypertensive disorders
           being the root cause of the transport

        -  The majority of the OB staff population being served at Miami Valley Hospital is African
           American. According to Myatt6, the incidence of pre-eclampsia in the African American
           population is greater than double the Caucasian population (11% to 5%) thereby making
           this study very applicable to the patient population served at Miami Valley Hospital.

        -  With the construct of the study, costs abe kept low by utilizing already established
           resources and practices (blood pressure cuffs, nurses, routine one week blood pressure
           checks) while only adding on the unit cost of furosemide.

        -  If treatment with labetalol and furosemide is found to be useful, it would be not only a
           very inexpensive, cost effective way of improving patient outcomes and possibly
           decreasing lengths of stay stateside, but in improving global practice in places that
           are lacking in resources privy to first world countries.

      Methods

        -  The study would be designed as:

             -  A prospective randomized 1:1 controlled trial including postpartum women with
                gestational hypertension or preeclampsia

             -  Patients with chronic hypertension would be excluded from the study

             -  One arm receiving 200mg labetalol BID alone on PPD#1 or 24 hours after magnesium
                sulfate

             -  One arm receiving 200mg labetalol BID and a five day course of furosemide 20mg QD
                on PPD#1 or 24 hours after magnesium sulfate

             -  Recording any occurrence when an increased amount of labetalol is needed to
                maintain blood pressures below 150 SBP and/or 100 DBP per ACOG recommendations.7

                ■ In the event of persistently elevated blood pressures, labetalol will be
                increased to 400mg TID and escalated to 600mg TID and finally 800mg TID as
                indicated

             -  Measurement of blood pressure every four hours after administration until patient
                discharge

             -  Measurement of urine output every 12 hours until discharge

             -  Compare average systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures between the two
                groups during admission and at one week postpartum

        -  Data will be collected using the OB Staff population at Miami Valley Hospital Main
           Campus.

        -  The research will be analyzed and interpreted by the research team conducting the study.

        -  Potential difficulties and limitations include compliance concerns of mandatory one week
           blood pressure follow up appointment.

        -  Using the Veena et al paper as a frame of reference, a sample size of 140 divided evenly
           across the two treatment arms would achieve statistical significance in determining the
           need to escalate anti-hypertensive therapy.

        -  The unit cost of one tablet of labetalol 200mg and furosemide 20mg is currently $0.32
           and $1.23, respectively. 8,9

        -  The study would use already readily available automated blood pressure cuff machines on
           the postpartum wing.

      Bowel preparation is a crucial step prior to colonoscopy to help with the optimal assessment
      of the colonic mucosa. Inadequate bowel preparation increases the length of the procedure,
      and is associated with decreased lesional detection rates. The ideal bowel preparation
      formulation should be able to completely clean the bowel, without leaving solid or liquid
      residues, and without modifying the mucosal appearance.

      Bowel preparation may be administered in hospitalised patients or in the ER. Patients have
      less control on their environment and the intake of the bowel preparation. For example, there
      may be a delay in pharmacy delivery or inadequate supervision by the treating personnel.
      Hospitalised patients have more comorbidities, are usually less autonomous and mobile - both
      can add to the barriers leading to an adequate bowel preparation. Multiple studies have
      identified hospitalization status as an independent risk factor for poor bowel preparation.

      The objective of this study is to access which bowel preparation regimen, between PEG 3350
      with electrolytes 2L the day before and 2L the day of the colonoscopy vs bisacodyl + PEG 3350
      with electrolytes 1L the day before and 1L the day of the colonoscopy, results in the
      cleanest bowel preparation in hospitalised patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the Atkinson Product Design

    ",Impact of Atkinson Product Design Urinary Slide Valve Versus Standard Catheter Drainage System on Social Functioning,"['Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary Tract Infections']",Urinary Tract Infections,"
      Several indications exist in urologic practice where urinary drainage via a urethral catheter
      is required and an estimated 4 million patients in the United States undergo urinary
      catheterization per year.(1) Though it is common for urine to be continually collected in a
      bag attached to the catheter by plastic tubing, catheter valves offer an alternative method
      of storing and voiding urine. Catheter valves are small devices that fit into the external
      end of the urethral catheter. Rather than continuous drainage, urine is stored in the bladder
      and emptied on regular intervals by opening the valve.

      This method of drainage may offer several benefits including preserving bladder capacity,
      function and tone, reducing catheter blockage in cases of urine bacterial colonization, and
      decreasing traction forces on the bladder neck by removing the downward weight of a
      collecting bag.(2-4) The use of a catheter valve may offer improvements in social functioning
      and mobility.(5) Studies to date suggest that catheter valves are well tolerated by patients,
      but these studies have used non-standardized questionnaires and have not assessed overall
      quality of life.(5, 6) Additionally, there may be an associated cost benefit to utilizing
      catheter valves compared to drainage bags.(5)

      Further study in this area, focusing on quality of life and social functioning, will enable
      the clinician to better counsel patients on the risks and benefits of the various methods of
      urinary drainage.

      Demographic data, social and medical histories, and clinical features at onset will be
      obtained via patient or family interview shortly after admission . We want to get the
      patients enrolled in our protocol as soon as possible because we believe that hyperglycemia
      levels greater than 200 mg/dl is a secondary insult that should be prevented as early as
      possible. However, a twelve-hour period after ICU admission is necessary for initial
      diagnosis and assessment of the patient's status in order to identify the patient as a
      potential study subject and to get consent from the patient's legal representative.

      Within twelve hours of ICU admission, qualifying patients will be randomized one of the two
      groups. Randomization will be based on computer-generated codes that will be maintained in
      sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The randomization will be stratified according to the
      severity of neurological injury based on GCS. The three stratification groups will be
      GCS=6-8, GCS=9-11 and GCS=12-14. Randomization will be done using random sized blocks within
      stratum, and patients will be randomized within stratum to either:

        1. Intensive intravenous insulin treatment (Target glucose levels of 80-110 mg/dl)

        2. Conventional intravenous insulin treatment (Target glucose levels of 150-170 mg/dl)

      All patients in the trial will have blood taken hourly for glucose analysis, regardless of
      their designated group. Adjustments of the insulin dose will be based on measurements of
      capillary blood glucose level. The interval between the glucose samples will be increased
      when patients satisfy discharge criteria from the intensive care unit. The insulin dose
      adjustments will be made by a team of intensive care nurses, assisted by a study nurse who is
      not otherwise involved in the clinical care of the patients. RBC transfusions, if necessary,
      will be administered one unit at a time, and the patient's hemoglobin concentration will be
      measured before and after each transfusion.

      All patients enrolled in the study will receive saline infusion supplemented with potassium.
      An orogastric or nasogastric feeding tube (Dobhoff tube) will be inserted. Enteral feeding
      will be started per feeding protocol with the goal of starting on day one. After insertion of
      a nasogastric or orogastric tube, tube position will be verified with abdominal x-ray.
      Enteral feeding will be instituted with 25 to 30 nonprotein kilocalories per kilogram of body
      weight per 24 hours and a balanced composition (including 0.13 to 0.26 g of nitrogen per
      kilogram per 24 hours and 20 to 40 percent of nonprotein in the form of lipids). 69 Formula
      used will be recorded. Patients will be fed continuously starting at a rate of 25 ml/hour. If
      continuous enteral feeding cannot be instituted or has to be stopped and enteral nutrition is
      anticipated to be interrupted for more than 7 days, total parenteral nutrition will be
      initiated. Patients will be allowed to progress to a regular oral diet after they have passed
      a swallowing study.

      The underlying neurological conditions will be managed by the neurosurgical team according to
      the protocols of the Department of Neurosurgery of the University of Louisville.

      When participating patients' physiological statuses have stabilized and the need for ICU
      monitoring and care is no longer necessary, they will be discharged to a lower level of care
      (in accordance with the 1999 guidelines of Task Force of the American College of Critical
      Care Medicine, Society of Critical Care Medicine). Upon discharge from ICU, patients in all
      groups will be treated with subcutaneous insulin according to established transition
      guidelines.

      Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a condition that impacts up to 60% of the growing
      postmenopausal female population, and the most common symptom is dyspareunia. Vaginal
      estrogen is the most common treatment for VVA, but it only marginally improves overall sexual
      function, and many women and clinicians avoid using it because of the risks of exogenous
      estrogen use during menopause. Ospemifene is a non-estrogen selective estrogen receptor
      modulator (SERM) that is FDA-approved for treating dyspareunia related to VVA, and has shown

      90 minutes.
    ",High Dose IV Lidocaine vs Hydromorphone for Abdominal Pain in the Emergency Department,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Renal Colic']","['Emergencies', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Renal Colic']","
      Abdominal pain is a common chief complaint for patients presenting to the emergency
      department (ED) in the United States. Intravenous opioids are commonly used to treat acute
      abdominal pain in the ED. These medications are highly efficacious and, when used in a
      monitored setting such as the ED, extremely safe. Use of opioids has fallen out of favor
      because of a spike in opioid-related overdose deaths throughout the United States. While use
      of opioids in the ED is unlikely to contribute to outpatient opioid deaths, minimizing the
      use of opioids in the ED will contribute to an opioid free culture, in which opioids are used
      only when absolutely necessary. A variety of different types of medications can be used in
      lieu of opioids. One such medication, intravenous lidocaine, has been used extensively for
      neuropathic pain, in the peri- and post-operative surgical setting, the cardiac care unit,
      and most recently in the emergency department.

      Intravenous lidocaine has long been used to treat pain. In publications dating back to 1980,
      intravenous lidocaine has been shown to be an effective treatment for neuropathic pain. In
      the postoperative setting, intravenous lidocaine decreased pain and decreased the need for
      opiates. More recently, emergency medicine investigators in Iran demonstrated that
      intravenous lidocaine decreased pain associated with renal colic and limb ischemia. An
      ED-based study in the United States showed comparable efficacy between morphine and
      intravenous lidocaine when used for acute pain. Most recently, a prospective RCT showed 120
      mg of intravenous lidocaine was efficacious for abdominal pain, albeit not as effective as 1
      mg of hydromorphone. However, a subgroup analysis showed that when lidocaine was dosed at 2
      mg/kg, it was equally as effective as hydromorphone.

      Over the years, intravenous lidocaine has been used for a variety of indications including
      arrhythmia prophylaxis in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Known side effects of
      intravenous lidocaine range from transient neurological symptoms (dizziness, paresthesias),
      to cardiac dysrhythmias and seizure. To date, no deaths have been attributed to its use for
      treating pain, and the only documented significant complication was due to an unintentional
      overdose when a patient received ten times the normal dose. All reported side effects in pain
      patients have been transient and resolved by either stopping the drug, decreasing the
      infusion rate or by observation alone. Additionally, doses of 2 mg/kg have been tolerated
      well in the outpatient setting, operating room and ED without any serious side effects. Thus,
      intravenous lidocaine is an emerging medication for safe and rapid relief of pain, has no
      known addictive properties, and creates a potential for a pain practice paradigm shift in the
      United States.

      We therefore propose a randomized, double blind, comparative efficacy trial to address the
      following aim:

      To determine if a 2 mg/kg dose of intravenous lidocaine is as equally efficacious as a single
      dose of 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone for acute abdominal pain in the emergency department.

      A new medication, Bezlotoxumab, has been approved for treatment of recurrent Clostridium
      difficile diarrhea by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The way this new medication
      works, is by binding the toxin produced by C. difficile bacteria and preventing damage to the
      large bowel. The toxin, and not the bacteria, is responsible for the damage, resulting in the
      clinical symptoms seen in patients. Sometimes, the infection can make a patient severely ill
      with organ failure and death. If severe enough, the infection requires surgery to remove the
      large bowel and allow the patient a better chance at recovery. Even with surgery and removal
      of the bowel, patients can continue to be severely ill and have a very high rate of
      mortality. The toxin that injures the large bowel has been shown to obtain access to systemic
      circulation because of the injury to the bowel. At this time, the investigators continue
      antibiotics and supportive care to help patients recover post-operatively, as the
      investigators do not have other interventions in this critical population. Bezlotoxumab is
      known to bind this toxin and stop it from causing further injury in the bowel; it has the
      potential to bind the systemic toxin to prevent further damage throughout the body. This
      study is proposing that this new medication, Bezlotoxumab, can be added to the current
      standard of care for severe infection that requires surgery, and result in a decrease of the
      complications associated with this disease process. In this study, some patients will receive
      the medication after surgery; others will receive extra fluid. The investigators will not
      know who received which in order to decrease any bias in the results. All participants will
      receive similar post-operative care and be monitored closely. When enough patients are
      enrolled in the study, the results will be evaluated.

      to continue SOFA score evaluations while the patient is in the surgical ICU. Consent will be
      obtained either from the patient or their legally authorized representative. Inclusion
      criteria will be all patients over the age of eighteen with diagnosed fulminant C. difficile
      colitis requiring surgical colectomy with end ileostomy. Surgical intervention will be
      determined by the operating surgeon at the time of initial consult assessment and during the
      follow-up assessments while the patient is hospitalized. Patients may be excluded on the
      account they are pregnant, prisoners/ incarcerated, have a history of congestive heart
      failure, or have received IVIG within 30 days of randomization to exclusion criteria.

      Randomization will be performed per best common practice guidelines with a computer-generated
      randomization process and hospital investigational pharmacy blinding processes into both a
      therapeutic arm (Bezlotoxumab) and a placebo (normal saline) arm of the study. All current
      standards of care will continue to be administered in these patients, regardless of their
      respective study arm. To control for the antibiotics administered, the patients will need to
      be stratified according to the standard-of-care antibiotics and balanced in regards to this
      variable. Current standard of care therapy at our institution for fulminant C. difficile
      colitis includes Vancomycin (both oral and rectal, if needed) and intravenous Metronidazole.
      Fulminant C. difficile colitis is defined, per our guidelines, as proven infection with
      hypotension/ shock, ileus, or megacolon.

      Upon conclusion of the surgical intervention, the Anesthesia or nursing team will administer
      the trial medication, Bezlotoxumab, or the placebo, normal saline. Dosing is planned to be
      ten milligrams per kilogram, which is standard dosing for therapeutic Bezlotoxumab approved
      for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This dose will be administered as a
      one-time single-infusion dose administered over the span of one hour. The placebo
      administration of normal saline will be at the same dosing with a single-infusion over one
      hour. The patient will receive standard of care post-operative management and the information
      obtained from standard-of-care lab draws will be assessed throughout their hospital stay. The
      patient will be seen and evaluated in clinic during the post-operative period at the
      one-month follow-up and either in clinic or via telephone at their three-month and six-month
      follow-up.

      Background:

      Coronary artery disease causes plaque in arteries. This can cause stroke or heart disease.
      Drugs called statins might shrink plaque. Researchers want to study how CT scanning can
      determine if an individuals arterial plaque has decreased while taking statins.

      Objectives:

      To measure the change in coronary artery plaque volume in people treated with high-intensity
      statin therapy using CT and MRI scans. To study the metabolic activity of plaque in arteries.
      To determine how well plaque measurements from heart CT scans can be replicated.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 40-75 and women ages 40-75 who are good candidates for statin treatment

      Design:

      Visit 1: participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Blood tests

        -  Heart MRI and CT scan: An IV inserted into an arm or hand vein removes blood and injects
           contrast, and medicine if needed. Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine
           that takes pictures of the body. For the CT scan, if their heart rate is too high, they
           get medicine to lower it. They breathe in a special way, holding their breath for 5
           seconds.

      Participants will begin high-intensity statin treatment.

      Participants will have 7 more visits over 3 years. All visits include blood tests and
      medication review. Some may also include:

        -  Statin treatment adjustment

        -  CT scan

        -  MRI scan

        -  Physical exam

      Participants may join the PET Substudy. This includes 5 more visits during the study. These
      include:

        -  Getting an IV in an arm vein

        -  Blood tests

        -  PET scans: They fast 12 hours before.

      Participants may join the Reproducibility Substudy if they had a slow heart rate during their
      first CT scan. This includes 1 additional heart CT scan 4 weeks later.
    ",CT COMPARE: CT Coronary Angiography to Measure Plaque Reduction,Cardiovascular Disease,Cardiovascular Diseases,"
      In high risk patients undergoing invasive angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has
      shown reduction of plaque for patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).
      However, there is no accepted noninvasive method to determine if treatment for
      atherosclerosis results in reduction of coronary artery plaque.

      Coronary artery CT angiography (CCTA) is noninvasive and can accurately determine the degree
      of coronary artery stenosis. In addition, the extent of calcified and noncalcified plaque may
      be directly measured using this technology at low radiation dose using state-of-the-art CT
      scanners. Several retrospective studies have previously suggested that CCTA may be able to
      show plaque regression in the coronary arteries due to statin therapy.

      The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the change in coronary artery plaque volume
      in individuals treated with high intensity statin therapy as defined by 2013 ACC/AHA
      Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk
      in Adults.

      Men and women who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo CCTA examination for
      the presence or absence of coronary artery plaque. Individuals with evidence of noncalcified
      coronary plaque by CCTA and who meet criteria for HMG-CoA reductase (statin) therapy will be
      evaluated for a total of 36 months. The change of coronary artery plaque (progression or no
      change, or regression) in individuals with noncalcified plaque at baseline will be measured
      by CCTA at yearly intervals.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      dexmedetomidine versus placebo, with lorazepam rescue, for the management of severe alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) in critically ill adults.

      The investigators hypothesize that the integration of dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) with usual
      therapy for the management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and alcohol withdrawal
      delirium/delirium tremens (AWD) in critically ill adult patients will reduce the time to
      resolution of AWS/AWD, increase the number of delirium-free and ventilator-free days in the
      first 28 days of hospitalization, reduce the length of ICU and hospital stays, and improve
      neurocognitive and quality of life scores on hospital discharge.
    ",Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) for Severe Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) and Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (AWD),"['Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium', 'Alcohol Withdrawal Associated Autonomic Hyperactivity', 'Alcohol Withdrawal Hallucinosis', 'Alcohol Withdrawal-Induced Delirium Tremens']","['Delirium', 'Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome']","
      Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) are frequent
      principal indication/s for admission to intensive care units. Additionally, unanticipated
      alcohol withdrawal complicates other critical illnesses and peri-operative states. Alcohol
      intoxication and withdrawal syndrome are characterized by classic symptoms of adrenergic
      activation, psychiatric agitation including seizures, as well as metabolic and respiratory
      dysfunction. The majority of patients with severe AWS are effectively managed with
      combinations of benzodiazepine (BZD) sedatives (e.g. lorazepam) and butyrophenone
      antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) and require intensive care admission for 2-3 days. However,
      almost 25% of patients with SAWS have a prolonged critical care course, often complicated by
      respiratory failure and associated with excessive sedation and risk for complications such as
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). AWS is frequently difficult to manage with usual care
      including benzodiazepines. Additionally, while intermittent bolus dose sedation is
      recommended for AWS, high dose BZD alone is associated with excessive respiratory suppression
      and metabolic acidosis. Such therapy increases the likelihood of respiratory failure with its
      attendant complications of hospital acquired pneumonia and sepsis. Further, patients with
      underlying chronic liver disease are at greater risk for prolonged sedative effects of BZD
      and progression of hepatic encephalopathy. The requirement for mechanical ventilation
      additionally prolongs the course of treatment for AWD because of the need for prolonged
      sedation. Strategies to control AWS/AWD that control symptoms but avoid adverse effects of
      excessive respiratory suppression are anticipated to improve the short and medium-term
      outcomes of AWS.

      BZD infusions have also been shown by several investigators to result in excessive and
      prolonged sedation. However, reasonable alternatives for effective control of psychomotor and
      adrenergic activation have until recently, been unavailable. The centrally acting alpha-2
      receptor agonist, clonidine has been suggested as a useful adjunctive therapy to BZD.
      However, clonidine is only a mild sedative and can result in significant hemodynamic
      compromise. By contrast, dexmedetomidine (Precedex), a more potent alpha-2 receptor agonist,
      is potentially a more effective adjunctive therapy. Precedex is currently marketed in the USA
      for short-term use as a potent peri-operative sedative and analgesic. This agent has a short
      circulating half-life and has significantly fewer hemodynamic side effects than clonidine. In
      addition to its cardiovascular properties, dexmedetomidine possesses anxiolytic,
      hypnotic/sedative, anesthetic-sparing and analgesic actions and is devoid of significant
      respiratory depressant effects.

      Precedex has been shown to be a safe and effective single agent sedative for critically ill
      medical and surgical patients in prolonged infusions up to thirty days and is associated with
      significantly lower incidence of delirium than sedation with the benzodiazepine, midazolam.
      Preclinical experience and case reports suggest anecdotally Precedex may be of particular
      benefit in patients with SAWS.

      Measures of sedation and delirium will be assessed with the Minnesota Detoxification Scale
      (MINDS) derived for use in critically ill adults from the validated Clinical Institute
      Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-r) scale.

      It is known that patients with aortic stenosis, including those undergoing cardiac surgery
      for this problem, are prone to developing bleeding problems, particularly of the
      gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that the shear stress associated with blood flow
      through the abnormal aortic valve results in abnormal hemostasis. Abnormalities include
      increased proteolysis of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and increased binding of the high
      molecular weight multimers of vWF to platelet membranes with subsequent inappropriate
      platelet aggregation. Thus, appropriate aggregation of circulating platelets is impaired.
      Cardiac surgery is associated with significant alterations in hemostasis. Patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery consume a significant percent of available blood products throughout the
      United States and are subjected to various and numerous risks associated with blood product
      transfusion. In addition, excessive postoperative bleeding is a common cause for the need to
      surgically re-explore the chest cavity in patients who have just undergone cardiac surgical
      procedures. Such additional surgery carries further cost and risk. Following surgical
      correction of aortic valve stenotic pathology, associated vWF abnormalities appear to
      reverse. However, this process can take several days. Although all cardiac surgical patients
      are at risk for postoperative bleeding, patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for aortic
      stenosis may be particularly at risk for this postoperative complication. In addition,
      patients with aortic valve stenosis who undergo noncardiac surgery may have a predisposition
      to bleeding because of similar underlying shear stress induced abnormal vWF and platelet
      function. The proposed study is a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different
      antifibrinolytic drugs in ameliorating the hemostatic defect associated with aortic stenosis.
      Aprotonin, an antifibrinolytic agent which also has platelet preserving actions4, will be
      compared to the currently used anti-fibrinolytic, epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA).
    ",Platelet Function And Aggregometry In Patients With Aortic Valve Stenosis,Hemorrhage,Hemorrhage,"
      Study subjects will be competent adult patients who are scheduled to undergo elective aortic
      valve surgery for severe aortic stenosis. The process of informed consent will begin prior to
      the day of surgery either during a patient's preoperative surgery clinic visit with one of
      the cardiac surgeons for any patient having such a clinic visit or during the preoperative
      anesthesia evaluation prior to the day of surgery. At one or both of these times patients
      will be told of the study and given a copy of the informed consent for their reading. An
      opportunity for them to discuss the study at this time will be offered. Written informed
      consent will be obtained on the day of surgery, prior to surgery. Patients must not also
      require coronary artery surgery or be taking or receiving drugs that alter platelet function,
      including aspirin (within the past 2 weeks) or any of the modern a ADP receptor antagonists
      such as Plavix. As per current patient care guidelines at Strong Memorial Hospital, patients
      undergoing first-time single valve, non-coronary artery surgical procedures will be
      randomized to receive either epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) or aprotonin intravenously. It
      is anticipated that 1-3 patients will be initially enrolled as pilot subjects to get the
      study going smoothly and that 1-3 patients may not be completed or that their testing and/or
      data may be inadequate. Therefore, although the analysis will only use 40 subjects the
      protocol seeks permission to enroll a maximum of 24 subjects per group for a total of 48
      patients.

      The tests to be performed are:

        1. the PFA-100, a platelet related hemostasis test which is a high shear system test of
           platelet function

        2. the von Willebrand antigen test, an immunoassay

        3. factor VIII coagulant activity test.

        4. Ristocetin cofactor activity test.

        5. thromboelastography (TEG), a point-of-care test of hemostatic function which includes a
           measure of platelet function.

      (Reference ranges / coefficient of variation / SD's / for the tests are as follows:

      vWF-Ag: 50 - 160% normal activity / 2 - 5% / ~5%

      FVIII: 50 - 200% of normal / 4 - 7% / ~5%

      Ristocetin cofactor: 60-200% of normal / ~15% / ~10%

      PFA100 closure time: epinephrine <181 seconds and ADP <112 seconds / ~12% / 20 secs)

      Total blood volume required from each patient for the purposes of doing the research related
      tests will be approximately 30 mls (1 fluid ounces or 2 tablespoons). 10 mls will be drawn
      from each patient's arterial line, which is routinely placed for cardiac anesthesia & surgery
      care, at the following time points in their care:

        1. prior to induction of anesthesia

        2. 5 minutes after the loading dose of either EACA or aprotonin has been administered and
           prior to the administration of any heparin

        3. 15 minutes after the administration of protamine following termination of
           cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Thus, no additional ""needle puncture"" will be necessary related to the study. Each blood
      sample of 10 ml will be divided into one ""blue-top"" (citrated) tube (3 ml) and kept on ice,
      one ""blue-top"" (citrated) tube (3 ml) and kept at room temperature, and the remainder will be
      used to perform the TEG.

      IV. Data Analysis and Monitoring:

      Statistical analysis will be performed using either a 2-sample t-test or the Mann-Whitney
      Test, as appropriate, to compare the two patient groups at each of the three time points. A
      p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant. All tests will be two-sided.

      With a proposed sample size of N = 20 for each of the two groups, the study will have at
      least 80% power to yield a statistically significant result.

      V. Data Storage and Confidentiality:

      Data will be produced within the SMH hematology lab and then stored both on paper and on the
      computer in the Department of Anesthesiology and backed up on the network drive.

      The principal investigator will maintain the information in a password protected file on the
      computer in his (their) private office.

      For HIV-infected patients who have access to treatment, liver diseases are a major cause of
      morbidity and mortality. Hepatitis C is the most frequently encountered liver condition in
      this population. Both diseases allow a higher level of poisonous substances (toxins) normally
      produced by the bacteria present in the gut to enter the bloodstream. This leads to a chronic
      inflammatory state, which results in faster development of liver scars (fibrosis) and
      ultimately, end stage disease (cirrhosis). To prevent this from happening, the use of
      antibiotics has been attempted to reduce the quantity of gut flora in the hopes of lowering
      the amount of toxins produced. These trials have shown promising results, but the antibiotics
      studied had major side effects and were not designed for continuous use. Rifaximin is a non
      absorbable antibiotic with very few side effects. It is already used for long periods of time
      in cirrhotic patients to treat the effects of cirrhosis on the brain (encephalopathy). This
      project will try to determine if rifaximin, by reducing the level of toxins produced by the
      bacteria in the gut, can improve the evolution of liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients
      with hepatitis C. In this pilot study, ten patients with HIV and HCV infection will be
      followed for one year. In addition, 10 patients with HCV mono infection will also be
      followed. Both populations will be included if they are starting on rifaximin, for its
      currently approved FDA indication (hepatic encephalopathy).

      Many studies have already proved the deleterious effects of LPS on HIV and hepatic diseases

      disease in these patients. To date, the only treatment is initiation of antiretroviral
      therapy. Rifaximin could be an easy and well tolerated way to improve the outcome of liver
      disease in HIV-infected patients. We hypothesize that it could help to slow down the
      progression of liver disease at any stage in these patients. This is a pilot study. A total
      of twenty patients placed on rifaximin by their physician for a mild hepatic encephalopathy
      will be monitored over a period of one year. The evaluation of the fibrosis will be done
      through transient elastography every 3 months. Bacterial translocation will be evaluated

      Interpretation of 99mTc sestamibi Study.

      A. A team of two blinded nuclear medicine physicians will interpret the 99mTc sestamibi, and
      any area of radioactivity will be graded as by a standard nuclear medicine grading system:

        1. Normal physiological activity

        2. Probably physiological activity

        3. Indeterminate activity

        4. Probably metastatic disease

        5. Metastatic disease

      B. Criteria for ""final determination"" regarding whether a finding represents physiological
      activity or metastatic disease:

        1. For findings graded as 1 or 2, they will be defined for this study as physiological
           activity.

        2. For findings graded as 3, or 4, the following will be required:

      i. Biopsy; however, this will only performed if clinically indicated.

      1. Follow-up: It is anticipated that very few biopsies will be performed and because the
      criteria for entering this study is NDCIS., the only alternative for confirming whether or
      not a foci of 99mTc sestamibi uptake on a scan is metastases will be follow up, which will be
      performed on a clinical basis. However, if on follow up any of the following occur, then the
      focus will be categorized as a metastases (true positive).

        1. Subsequent biopsy,

        2. Subsequent clinical imaging study(s) (For example, although a lytic bone lesion in the
           area of interested was not present initially on the CT, a lytic lesion indicative of
           metastases may subsequently develop in that area, and for this study this will be
           defined as evidence of metastases of DTC (true positive).

           ii. Blind I-131 treatment** with or without a prefatory scan: If a ""blind"" I-131
           treatment"" is clinically selected and the post I-131 therapy scan demonstrates uptake in
           the same areas as the 99mTc sestamibi, then the finding on the 99mTc sestamibi will be
           classified for this study as a metastases of DTC.

        3. Grade 5 is not anticipated, because unlikely I-131, which can have patterns that are
           very specific for DTC, 99mTc sestamibi patterns are not specific for DTC.

             -  A ""blind I-131 treatment"" is a potential therapeutic option, and this term means
                that the treating physician or team cannot identify the source of the patient's
                elevated Tg, but because of factors such as the level of elevated Tg, the rate of
                rise of the Tg, and the patient's clinical situation, a therapeutic administration
                of I-131 is give despite being ""blind"" to the source of the Tg.

      Depression is frequently seen in cardiac patients. It has been shown that depression often
      has a negative impact on the course of coronary disease. More recently, research has
      demonstrated that some antidepressants can be used safely to treat depressed coronary
      patients. Although the majority of patients improve substantially with antidepressant
      treatment, a significant proportion do not respond to antidepressants. This project seeks to
      better understand why depression does not improve equally well in all patients. Ultimately,
      the hope is to improve the treatments available to people affected by both cardiac disease
      and depression, and to help select the best type of treatment in advance for each individual
      based on his or her personal history, and biological characteristics.
    ",Antidepressants to Promote Recovery of Cardiac Patients Suffering From Depression,"['Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Major Depressive Episode']","['Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Syndrome']","
      In this study 140 patients who have had a recent hospitalization for an acute coronary
      syndrome and who have major depression will all receive 12 weeks of treatment with the
      antidepressant citalopram and regular clinical management visits from a mental health
      professional. The objective is to examine the characteristics of depressed cardiac patients
      who do and do not show an improvement in depression with citalopram treatment. There is
      evidence that the causes of depression may be different in some people with cardiac disease
      than in individuals who do not have heart problems, and these differences may be at least
      partially involved in determining response to antidepressant treatment. Inflammation, one of
      the body's responses to the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries and
      blockages in the heart) may be particularly important in producing depression in cardiac
      patients. There may also be changes in the body's metabolism of tryptophan, a protein that is
      involved in making serotonin, and levels of serotonin are often low in depression. Other
      factors thought to influence the development of depression include childhood experiences and
      personality factors. Heredity and family history also seem to play a role in some people with
      depression and heart disease. Finally, some patients experience sleep apnea, interruptions in
      breathing while they are asleep, that can contribute to both cardiac disease and depression.

      Patients with hip fractures are most often old, have multiple comorbidities and suffer severe
      pain.

      Femoral nerve block as a means of preoperative analgesia for these patients has proven
      effective in multiple trials for the majority of the patients. Still some issues remains to
      be investigated in order to optimize the preoperative analgesia for this group.

      One of the issues that reduces the feasibility of the femoral nerve block is the relatively
      shorter analgesic duration of the nerve block compared to the often longer time from the
      hospital admission to the actual operation. From the literature and our own experience the
      mean analgesic duration of a femoral nerve block approximates 15 hours.

      Many studies have shown a prolonged analgesic duration of different nerve blocks when
      Dexamethasone was added to the local anesthetics. Some studies show a 100 percent increase in
      duration.

      To our knowledge no studies have been published regarding prolongation of the analgesic
      effect of the femoral nerve block with Dexamethasone, and also none regarding the group of
      patients with hip fracture.

      The clinical impact of a femoral nerve block with an analgesic duration of 20 hours compared
      to the present 15 hours would be less patients waking up in wards during the night time with
      pain and a terminated femoral nerve block.

      Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme involved in the development and functioning of the
      immune system. Deficiency of ADA results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a fatal
      inherited immune disorder. Strimvelis is a gene therapy that aims to insert ADA function into
      blood cells and halt or reverse the conditions caused by decreased ADA enzyme levels, such as
      impaired immune function. It is important to consider long term follow-up of patients who
      have received Strimvelis, including evaluation of the risk of insertion near certain genes
      that may lead to unexpected activation of those genes (oncogenesis). The objective of this

      Almost 15% of Americans have chronic kidney disease (CKD), with an even higher rate in
      Veterans due to common risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes. People with CKD
      have a high risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases, such as heart attacks, heart failure, and
      strokes. Extra fluid in the body, called volume overload, may lead to CV disease in people
      with CKD. It is unknown if volume overload develops in the earliest stages of CKD, when
      treating it with common, inexpensive medicines called diuretics may improve long-term CV
      outcomes. This study will lay important groundwork to answer this question in Veterans with
      early CKD by comparing two ways to measure volume overload and studying the change in common
      symptoms like fatigue and short-term CV function after treatment with diuretic medicines.
    ","Association of Diuretics With Change in Extracellular Volume, Natriuretic Peptides, Symptoms, and Cardiovascular Outcomes in CKD",Chronic Kidney Disease,"['Kidney Diseases', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic']","
      The investigators previously showed that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and
      N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP), measures of ventricular stretch, are associated with death
      and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-3 patients, and the
      investigators' preliminary pilot results suggest that these natriuretic peptides may
      correlate with objective measures of excess extracellular volume (ECV) and with symptoms
      common in CKD. The overarching objective is to determine if initiation of diuretic treatment
      or increase in dose is associated with changes in BNP and NT-pro-BNP, patient-reported
      symptom burden, and short-term hemodynamic parameters in patients with CKD stages 1-3 and
      elevated blood pressure, and whether these changes correlate with changes in ECV. The central
      hypothesis is that the change in ECV after starting or increasing diuretics in Veterans with
      stages 1-3 CKD is associated with changes in 1) natriuretic peptides, 2) patient-level
      factors, and 3) CV physiology.

      The investigators will compare the changes in natriuretic peptides, symptoms, and CV
      parameters with the change in ECV after diuretic initiation or dose increase. The primary aim
      is to determine if initiation of diuretic treatment or increase in diuretic dose is
      associated with changes in natriuretic peptides. Secondary aims are to determine the effect
      of diuretic change on patient-reported symptom burden, and CV physiology.

      This clinical trial will include 46 outpatients with CKD stages 1-3 and blood pressure
      >140/90 mmHg. At the first visit, I will initiate or increase the dose of a thiazide or loop
      diuretic. Study measures other than echocardiogram will be repeated 4 weeks after the
      intervention to determine changes in these parameters. ECV will be measured by whole-body
      multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), which is a validated, non-invasive, painless
      measure of ECV. Plasma BNP and NT-pro-BNP will be measured, and patient-reported fatigue,
      depression, and quality of life will be quantified using validated questionnaires.
      Hemodynamic parameters include blood pressure, pulse pressure, total peripheral resistance
      index (TPRI), and cardiac index measured by Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring. A
      transthoracic echocardiogram will measure left ventricular mass index, valvular disease, and
      diastolic dysfunction.

      Variables will be compared within participants between baseline and Visit 2 using paired
      Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests or paired Student's t tests, depending on variable distributions.
      Correlations between change in ECV/total body weight and all continuous outcome measures will
      be analyzed using Spearman or Pearson correlations, applying appropriate transformations.
      Linear regression analysis will control for clinically relevant variables. The relationship
      between ECV/total body weight and natriuretic peptides from both visits will be evaluated
      using a mixed effects model to account for the change in these measures between baseline and
      Visit 2.

      This study is minimal risk to human subjects. Participants may benefit from improved control
      of their blood pressure. The knowledge to be gained may also benefit others in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of CKD stages 1, 2, or 3, as defined below by National Kidney Foundation
             guidelines, for a period of at least 3 months.

               -  Stage 1: eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30
                  mg/g.

               -  Stage 2: eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30
                  mg/g.

               -  Stage 3: eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          -  Measured blood pressure either >140 mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastolic at the two
             most recent clinic visits.

               -  Rationale: The investigators' unpublished preliminary data show that blood
                  pressure correlates with both BNP and NT-pro-BNP more strongly in those with CKD
                  than those without CKD. Thus, selecting hypertensive individuals is more likely
                  to identify those with elevated natriuretic peptides in the CKD group.

               -  Furthermore, starting or increasing a diuretic medication is part of standard of
                  care to treat blood pressures >140/90 mmHg, so the study intervention will be
                  consistent with appropriate care for the Veteran and avoid hypotension.

      This study will measure in children how much numbing medicine, lidocaine, is absorbed into
      the bloodstream after it is injected into a blood clot (hematoma) around a forearm fracture
      for pain control when the broken bone is moved back into place (fracture reduction). This is
      called a hematoma block and is commonly used in the Emergency Unit. To help with anxiety and
      to add additional pain control, nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is given while the lidocaine
      hematoma block is placed and continued during the fracture reduction. Advantages of using
      this technique for pain control instead of an intravenous anesthetic such as ketamine include
      faster recovery and discharge home, and longer pain control.

      Of concern, if too much lidocaine is absorbed into the bloodstream, seizures and irregular
      heart beating may occur. Bloodstream concentrations of lidocaine after a hematoma block have
      been measured in only one study of 8 adults and found to be at significant but safe levels.
      No study has been published in children to measure bloodstream lidocaine levels when a
      hematoma block is used. Because children's bones are still growing and more metabolically
      active than adult bones, the investigators believe it is important to determine whether
      lidocaine blood levels in children are also at safe levels when using a standard lidocaine
      hematoma block for reduction of fractures. The investigators also want to determine whether
      bloodstream lidocaine levels correlate with type of fracture.

      The investigators also aim to determine if there is a difference in absorption pattern
      between different types of distal radius fractures, if there is a correlation between
      fracture type and systemic lidocaine absorption, and if there is a correlation between
      fracture type and ability to provide adequate pain and sedation control with lidocaine
      hematoma block/inhaled nitrous combination. The investigators believe blood lidocaine levels
      after hematoma block in children will peak at safe levels, but will be higher than those
      observed in adults.

      When a subject with an eligible distal forearm fracture is identified, the subject will be
      approached for enrollment and consent.

      50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen then will be administered to the subject by face mask for a
      minimum of 2 minutes before venous catheter insertion (50% nitrous oxide will continue to be
      administered until fracture reduction is completed). Nitrous oxide currently is administered
      regularly in the St. Louis Children's Emergency Department for painful procedures including
      fracture reduction, abscess incision and drainage, laceration repair and venous catheter
      placement. Nitrous oxide 50% blended with 50% oxygen will be administered for this study by
      credentialed emergency unit staff using a continuous flow delivery system that includes
      scavenging of exhaled nitrous oxide. Standard monitoring for deep sedation will be used as
      described in the clinical protocol.

      A venous catheter then will be inserted into the uninjured arm. A lidocaine hematoma block
      will be injected under ultrasound guidance by a pediatric emergency medicine physician using
      2.5 mg/kg, maximum of 100mg, of 1% buffered lidocaine. The recommended lidocaine dose for
      hematoma block in children is 3-5 mg/kg. However, in a previous study, in another pediatric
      trial, and in the single report of plasma lidocaine levels in adults, 2.5 mg/kg of 1%
      lidocaine based upon the patient's weight, maximum 100 mg, was found effective and without
      adverse effects. The Pediatric Sedation State Scale will be administered by the sedation
      provider, and a research assistant when available, and used to determine if pain control is
      adequate, or if rescue IV analgesia is needed. This scale has been validated for procedural
      sedation.

      Serial blood samples will be drawn through the indwelling venous catheter by a nurse or medic
      at 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after injection of the hematoma block. Serial plasma
      lidocaine levels will be measured as follows. 5 mL samples of blood will be obtained via the
      indwelling venous catheter at 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after injection of the lidocaine
      hematoma block. The samples of blood will be collected in standard red top vacutainer blood
      tubes and processed, frozen and stored in the SLCH/BJC Lab.

      At 5 minutes after the hematoma block injection, the orthopedic surgeon will attempt fracture
      reduction. If the subject has minimal response to squeezing the fracture site prior to 5
      minutes post injection, reduction may begin at that time. Nitrous oxide administration will
      be stopped and administration of 100% oxygen will begin when the orthopedic surgeon indicates
      satisfactory fracture reduction as determined by bedside fluoroscopy (standard procedure), a
      cast or splint has been applied, and, if necessary, the cast has been split. Oxygen
      administration will be stopped when the subject's exhaled nitrous oxide concentration falls
      below 10% or the subject pulls the nitrous oxide mask off the face.

      If the subject resists the fracture reduction, verbally indicates significant pain, or has an
      unfavorable PSSS, ketamine sedation will be administered via the indwelling venous catheter
      and fracture reduction completed under deep sedation. Post procedure pain score via the
      Wong-Baker Faces scale, and post procedure surveys will be administered 15 minutes after
      nitrous administration is stopped. After the subject's recovery from sedation, the subject,
      subject's parents/guardians, physician providing sedation (inhaled nitrous) and the
      orthopedic surgeon will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the sedation and analgesia
      for the fracture reduction using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not satisfied at all) to 10
      (very satisfied). Recovery from sedation satisfactory for discharge home is indicated by a
      score of 10 on the Modified Aldrete Scale below, and the child can sit up unaided along with
      control of pain and vomiting. Family will be contacted via telephone 48 hours after their
      visit to assess for any late adverse effects.

      Adverse events will be documented on a data collection sheet using consensus-based
      definitions that include the event, time and any intervention employed. In addition, the
      subject will be asked about symptoms typically seen with procedural sedation and lidocaine
      toxicity including: vomiting, nausea, tinnitus, circumoral or tongue numbness, metallic taste
      in mouth, nystagmus, vision changes, muscle twitching, tremors, seizure, respiratory
      depression, chest pain, difficulty breathing, palpitations, ECG changes on monitor (type
      noted, ECG strip printed), and any other unpleasant or euphoric symptom.

      Suicide is a significant public health problem. Depression, alcoholism (abuse or dependence),
      and a prior suicide attempt are risk factors for suicide. However, little information exists
      to guide clinicians in the choice of antidepressant medication for patients with comorbid
      major depression and alcoholism who are at risk for suicidal acts.

      There is evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) may reduce impulsive
      aggression, and therefore lower the risk for suicidal behavior. We will test the hypothesis
      that fluoxetine, an SSRI, will be associated with fewer suicide events (defined as suicidal
      acts or increases in suicidal ideation necessitating a change in management), decreased
      suicidal ideation and decreases in neuropsychological measures of impulsivity compared to
      bupropion. The non-serotonergic drug, bupropion will improve energy and hopelessness. We
      expect the two drugs to be equally efficacious in reducing global depression severity. We
      will compare fluoxetine with bupropion in a 6-month randomized, controlled study of major
      depressive disorder and comorbid alcoholism in patients who have a prior history of suicide

      receive weekly psychotherapy.

      We will study 42 subjects with a current major depressive episode, comorbid alcoholism and a
      history of a past suicide attempt (21 subjects per year) in a randomized, double-blind,
      controlled trial, stratified by alcoholism type (1 vs 2). All subjects with alcohol
      dependence will be evaluated for risk of alcohol withdrawal prior to randomization. We will
      include patients who have suicidal ideation. However, patients with a suicidal plan or intent
      will only be enrolled as inpatients if the research team and the independent treatment team
      on the inpatient research unit agree that this is clinically reasonable. For example, if ECT
      or antipsychotics are indicated, the patient will not be enrolled. The study will provide six
      months of antidepressant pharmacotherapy as well as psychotherapy focused on alcohol relapse
      prevention. Patients will also be encouraged to attend daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
      The outcome measures will be: 1) occurrence of suicide events; 2) reduction of suicidal
      ideation; 3) reduction in neuropsychological measures of impulsivity.

      This is a study of mechanically ventilated pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) teenage
      patients and the effects of the medication dexmedetomidine on sleep, delirium, and sedation
      level. The Investigators will assess sleep with an 8 lead polysomnogram study and increase
      the medication at night for one night to see if the sleep architecture changes. The
      Investigators will assess their sleep with our unit's sedation protocol for an additional
      night.
    ",Dexmedetomidine Cycling and Sleep in the Pediatric ICU,"['Critical Illness', 'Sedation Complication', 'Delirium']",Critical Illness,"
      Background: Sleep deprivation is a common problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Poor
      sleep is both a modifiable risk factor for improved recovery from severe illness and for
      delirium which is associated with increased mortality (1, 2). Sleep deprivation is a
      physiological stressor that can affect the autonomic, immune, metabolic, and hormonal
      functions of the body. Inflammatory cytokines are increased during sleep deprivation and
      hormonal responses to stress which are already affected by critical illness are worsened with
      lack of sleep (3, 4).

      Sedation greatly confounds the ability to distinguish if a patient is asleep or simply deeply
      sedated particularly in the mechanically ventilated pediatric population. Kudchadkar et.al
      looked at sleep architecture using limited montage electroencephalogram and saw that sleep
      was abnormal on sedative infusions although this study did not look at dexmedetomidine
      infusion (5). However, polysomnography as the gold standard to asses sleep can offer more
      details about sleep architecture including arousal index. It is well known that sedatives
      have natural sleep properties, but The Investigators do not have much data on how they impact
      sleep architecture in the pediatric population. When attempting to describe sleep in the ICU,
      sleep is inaccurately determined by bedside providers clinically (6-8). The age and severity
      of illness of intubated pediatric patients them poor candidates for self-reporting using a
      behavioral scales to describe sleep. Evaluating sleep using polysomnography both removes
      observer inaccuracy and provides information on the sleep architecture of patients on
      sedative infusions.

      Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used infusion for sedation in the ICU that also has natural
      sleep properties. It is an alpha 2 agonist that acts at the locus coeruleus which is involved
      in arousal (9). It mimics natural sleep in animal models (10). Dexmedetomidine is commonly
      used in pediatric intensive care units, although its use has gained increased popularity in
      the last five years. While some pediatric intensivists cycle, increase the dose at night, of
      dexmedetomidine to reduce delirium, there is only adult data describing an association
      between nocturnal dexmedetomidine infusion and reduced delirium (11,12). There are no studies
      published assessing sleep architecture via polysomnography in pediatric patients on
      dexmedetomidine infusions. The Investigators aim to assess sleep architecture as well as
      incidence of delirium in patients who have dexmedetomidine infusions increased during
      nocturnal hours.

      It is well established that critically ill children and adults have poor sleep quality and
      quantity during an ICU stay. Emerging research suggests sleep may improve patient outcomes by
      mitigating negative effects of the ICU environment such as delirium. Many of the sedatives
      used in the ICU may disrupt sleep architecture, but pharmacologic studies suggest the
      sedative dexmedetomidine may improve sleep. Clinical studies in critically ill adults have
      shown benefit to using dexmedetomidine sedation overnight, or by increasing the dose at night
      for patients receiving continuously. Pediatric intensivists have started increasing
      dexmedetomidine infusion doses at night for delirious patients with anecdotal improvements in
      mental status and delirium state the following day, but no evidence has been published to
      support this practice.

      Study: The purpose of this small pilot study is to assess if nocturnal sleep quality and
      quantity improves with increasing the dose of continuous intravenous infusion of
      dexmedetomidine exclusively to attain a targeted Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)
      state in intubated and critically ill pediatric patients between the age of 12 and 17 in the
      pediatric intensive care unit instead of utilizing increasing doses of 2-3 agents with
      dexmedetomidine being one of them. The FDA has not approved this medication for use in
      children, so this study will only enroll patients already placed on the medication by their
      care team as it is already used by this unit in spite of lack of FDA approval for pediatrics.
      An Investigational New Drug (IND) application was submitted to the FDA and this study was
      deemed IND exempt (IND 155894). For the control night, the Investigators will make no
      modifications to the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital approved pediatric intensive care unit
      sedation protocol. The Investigators will use the same titration and approved maximum doses
      which are as follows: Initiate fentanyl infusion at 1 mcg/kg/hr and dexmedetomidine infusion
      at 0.3 mcg/kg/hr, if RASS greater than desired RASS implement the following in order until
      RASS goal is met. Step 1: Give fentanyl bolus of 1 mcg/kg, reassess in 10 minutes; Step 2:
      Repeat fentanyl bolus of 1 mcg/kg and increase drip by 1 mcg/kg/hr, reassess in 10 minutes;
      Step 3: Give dexmedetomidine bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg, reassess in 10 minutes; Step 4: Repeat
      dexmedetomidine bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg and increase drip by 0.3 mcg/kg/hr, reassess in 10
      minutes. Repeat steps 1-4 until goal RASS reached or at max drips (fentanyl 5 mcg/kg/hr and
      dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/kg/hr). For the intervention night, the Investigators will use the same
      titration and maximum dose of dexmedetomidine that is Vanderbilt Children's Hospital
      approved. The Investigators will start the dexmedetomidine where the patients daytime
      providers have dosed it and titrate to a targeted RASS goal one level deeper. The
      Investigators will follow the unit titration of using 0.5 mcg/kg bolus and increasing the
      drip by 0.3 mcg/kg/hr. Reassess RASS 10 minutes later, and if not at desired RASS goal,
      repeat bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg and increase by 0.3 mcg/kg/hr until either the desired RASS goal
      is met or a maximum of 2 mcg/kg/hr is reached.

      The Investigators aim to enroll children who are currently receiving mechanical ventilation
      and dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation per current pediatric ICU practice and assess the
      effects of preferentially increasing dexmedetomidine infusion on nocturnal sleep
      architecture. The Investigators will assess sleep using an 8 lead montage of polysomnography.
      Each patient will wear the polysomnogram leads for two nights. One of the two nights will
      follow the intensive care unit sedation protocol (allowing for use of other sedatives as
      needed) versus increasing the dose of dexmedetomidine to a target Richmond Agitation-Sedation
      Scale state one level deeper than what was targeted during the day. Those interpreting the
      sleep studies will be blinded to which night was the night that the dexmedetomidine infusion
      was preferentially increased.

      Statins (HMG-Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are widely used clinically as lipid lowering
      drugs; however they have also been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
      properties(1). Recently published large retrospective cohort studies, in patients with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggest that statins reduce mortality and COPD
      related admissions(2). Possible mechanisms of action include effects on cell adhesion
      molecules, changes in inflammatory mediator release, antioxidant effect and increased
      clearance of apoptoic cells. Simvastatin has been shown to reduce the development of smoking
      induced emphysema in rats with reductions in MMP-9 activity and simvastatin withdrawal leads
      to increased MMP levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients. Serum concentrations of TNFa and
      high sensitive C Reactive protein(3) (hs-CRP) are reduced with simvastatin therapy in
      patients with hypercholesterolaemia and risk of cardiovascular disease respectively. No
      clinical trial has directly evaluated the clinical effects of statins in patients with COPD
      in terms of induced sputum MMP profile, alveolar nitric oxide or pulmonary physiology.

      We have modified our published method of RNA purification, developed to purify RNA from
      cartilage, tendon or synovium(4), to yield good quality RNA from sputum with relative
      simplicity and low cost. We have identified MMP-2, -9 and -14 in the sputum of healthy
      volunteers (unpublished pilot data) and will utilise this technique in the current study.
      Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is completely non-invasive, requires no co-operation from
      individuals and provides information about a number of inflammatory and oxidation pathways.
      Markers of oxidative stress (8-isoprostane and hydrogen peroxide) and nitric oxide products
      can be measured in exhale breath condensate(5) and are related to disease activity in
      patients with COPD. Markers of oxidative stress increase in concentration in EBC during
      exacerbations of COPD are reduced after treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine(6).
      Hydrogen peroxide is not stable and therefore 8-isoprostane is a preferable marker of
      oxidative stress unless the sample is measured on line.

      The primary objectives of this randomized clinical trial are to evaluate if perioperative SDD

      might simultaneously improve.
    ",Does Administration of Antibiotics in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Colorectal Cancer Result in Less Complications and Better Prognosis?,Colorectal Cancer,Colorectal Neoplasms,"
      Rationale:

      Infectious complications and especially anastomotic leakage severely impede the recuperation
      of patients following colorectal cancer surgery. When the normal gut barrier fails such as in
      anastomotic leakage, pathogenic microorganisms like Gram-negative bacteria enter the
      circulation and may cause severe sepsis which is associated with considerable mortality.
      Moreover, anastomotic leakage has a negative impact on colorectal cancer prognosis. Selective
      decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is a prophylaxis regimen that employs oral
      nonabsorbable antibiotics to eradicate pathogenic micro-organisms like Gram-negative
      bacteria.

      Objective:

      The primary objectives of this randomized clinical trial are to evaluate if perioperative SDD
      can reduce clinical anastomotic leakage rate and its septic consequences as well as other
      infectious complications. By reduction of septic complications long-term oncological outcome
      might simultaneously improve. Secondary objectives are a decline in reoperation rate,
      in-hospital mortality, readmission rate, duration of hospital stay and ICU admission,
      non-infectious complications, improvement of quality of life and reduction of costs.

      Study design:

      A randomised multicenter clinical trial comparing perioperative SDD in addition to standard
      antibiotic prophylaxis with standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone in patients with colorectal
      cancer who undergo elective surgical resection with curative intent.

      Study population:

      Patients 18 years or older are eligible for inclusion when they are diagnosed with colon or
      rectal cancer without signs of distant metastases. Patients may be scheduled for either
      laparoscopic or open resection with curative intent, including construction of an anastomosis
      (either with or without diverting stoma). Patients are not eligible for inclusion in case of
      concomitant metastases or acute obstruction.

      Intervention:

      Patients are randomly allocated for either perioperative SDD (intervention group) including
      standard antibiotic prophylaxis or standard treatment (including standard antibiotic
      prophylaxis alone) (control group). The solution containing SDD is orally taken 4 times
      daily, starting 3 days before surgery and continued until normal bowel passage or at least 3
      days after surgery. Both groups receive a single preoperative intravenous dose of 1000 mg
      Cefazoline and 500 mg Metronidazole, which is the current standard antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The main study parameter is anastomotic leakage. The research hypothesis refers to an
      estimated decrease in anastomotic leakage rate in the SDD treated group (from 9% to 4%). As
      anastomotic leakage has been shown unfavourable forlong term oncological outcome, we presume
      an improvement in disease free survival, which serves as important secondary endpoint.

      To determine if the use of insulin isophane results in improved control of blood sugars
      compared to the use of insulin glargine in new onset diabetes after kidney, lung, or heart
      transplantation (NODAT).
    ",Comparison of Insulin Therapy in Treating Post-Transplant Diabetes,Diabetes Mellitus,Diabetes Mellitus,"
      A large percentage of organ transplant recipients develop de novo diabetes mellitus after
      transplantation, also called ""New Onset Diabetes After Transplant"" or NODAT. The cause of the
      diabetes appears to be commonly used anti-rejection medications, particularly calcineurin
      inhibitors and glucocorticoids.

      Management of glucose levels in NODAT often requires insulin therapy. Standard practice is to
      start long-acting insulin. However, patients with NODAT often exhibit fasting morning glucose
      levels that are relatively low compared to pre-lunch and pre-dinner glucose levels. This
      seems to make NODAT patients more susceptible to fasting, or morning, hypoglycemia on
      long-acting insulin analogues than non-transplant patients with type II diabetes. This
      phenomenon of morning hypoglycemia in NODAT often limits the up-titration of basal insulin
      resulting in suboptimal treatment of hyperglycemia later in the day. Because of this pattern,
      transplant patients may respond better to morning insulin isophane (intermediate acting) than
      to long-acting insulin glargine preparations.

      Our trial is designed to compare morning NPH insulin (isophane insulin) with conventional
      therapy of basal glargine insulin on both continuous blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c
      (glycosylated hemoglobin).

      The investigators hypothesize that a combination therapy using miglustat and the ketogenic
      diet for infantile and juvenile patients with gangliosidoses will create a synergy that 1)
      improves overall survival for patients with infantile or juvenile gangliosidoses, and 2)
      improves neurodevelopmental clinical outcomes of therapy, compared to data reported in
      previous natural history studies. The ketogenic diet is indicated for management of seizures
      in patients with seizure disorders. In this study, the ketogenic diet will be used to
      minimize or prevent gastrointestinal side-effects of miglustat. A Sandhoff disease mouse
      study has shown that the ketogenic diet may also improve central nervous system response to
      miglustat therapy (see Denny in ""Citations"" list below). Patients with infantile and juvenile
      gangliosidoses commonly suffer from seizure disorders, and use of the ketogenic diet in these
      patients may therefore also improve seizure management.

      The infantile and juvenile forms of GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses are neurodegenerative
      conditions that are lethal during childhood. There are no known effective therapies available
      for treatment of infantile and juvenile gangliosidoses. Studies of monotherapy with miglustat
      for treatment of these conditions have demonstrated safety, but have not demonstrated notable
      clinical improvement. To date, combination therapy for the infantile and juvenile
      gangliosidoses has not been explored. This study will evaluate a multi-targeted combination
      therapy for treatment of the gangliosidoses, using FDA approved therapies that have
      demonstrated safety in children. It is the aim of this study to learn if combination therapy
      using the ""Syner-G"" regimen (that is, synergistic enteral regimen for treatment of the
      gangliosidoses) will show improvement in overall survival and clinical benefits in
      neurodevelopmental abilities in children with gangliosidosis diseases.

      This study is planned as a 5-year longitudinal treatment study. Subjects will be started on
      the treatment regimen when they are enrolled in the study. Data will be collected during
      yearly evaluations and at completion of study. Investigators may choose to stop therapy at
      any time, as clinically indicated for individual patients.

      The Ketogenic Diet is a special diet that contains higher amounts of fat and lower amounts of
      carbohydrate compared to an average diet. The purpose of this is to help reduce
      food-miglustat interactions. The ketogenic diet may also help in management of seizures in
      these patients. (The ketogenic diet has been used as an anti-seizure treatment in a variety
      of medical conditions for many decades.) A study in Sandhoff disease mice has shown that the
      ketogenic diet may also help miglustat be more effective in the central nervous system (see
      Denny in ""Citations"" list below).

      Miglustat will be used to reduce the amount of ganglioside accumulation in the child's cells.
      Miglustat is not FDA approved for treatment of the gangliosidoses. It is FDA approved for a
      different inherited metabolic disease called Gaucher disease type I.

      compression to the lower limb in order to improve venous return and to reduce edema.

      Polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM) is an injectable foam medication that is used to treat
      symptoms of venous disease, including venous leg ulcers (VLUs). The medication
      (""polidocanol"") is in the foam (""endovenous microfoam""). PEM is injected through a catheter
      or by direct injection into the malfunctioning vein. The foam fills and treats the desired
      section of the vein, thereby collapsing the diseased vein. When the malfunctioning vein
      collapses, the microfoam is deactivated and blood flow shifts to healthier veins nearby.

      In couples with infertility secondary to Diminished Ovarian Reserve, the investigators
      hypothesize that a delayed start (7 day) to ovarian stimulation with an GnRH antagonist
      (Ganirelix) will improve oocyte maturation and quality, and improve pregnancy outcomes.
    ",Delayed Start to Ovarian Stimulation,"['Diminished Ovarian Reserve', 'Infertility', 'In Vitro Fertilization']",Infertility,"
      Over the past two decades, the success rate of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has
      dramatically increased. This increase is attributed to improvements in embryo culture,
      laboratory conditions, and optimization of ovarian stimulation protocols. Over the past
      years, there has been more interest in altering the ovarian stimulation protocol to improve
      outcomes. For example, recently our group found that a modification of ovulation trigger
      toward a more physiologic process improves oocyte quality and pregnancy outcomes. Others have
      suggested minimal stimulation improves in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. The
      investigators propose to further investigate modifying the ovarian stimulation for women who
      have ""decreased"" ovarian reserve. The investigators propose that a delayed start to ovarian
      stimulation will improve oocyte maturation and quality and pregnancy outcomes. No published
      studies to date have evaluated if a delayed start to ovarian stimulation improves pregnancy
      outcomes. However, the investigators hypothesize that the use an antagonist for a delayed
      start of stimulation will work by one of two mechanisms:

      I. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further recruitment of early antral
      follicles.

      II. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further FSH responsiveness in existing
      follicles to synchronize the primary cohort, thereby increasing the total number of
      follicles.

      This is a three-arm prospective double-blinded randomized comparative trial. Experienced
      interventional radiologists and anesthetists at the MUHC and study affiliated centers will
      carry out all interventions.

        -  72 consecutive subjects meeting the eligibility criteria, considered for knee
           replacement in the future.

        -  Patients will be referred for consideration for the study by specialized arthroplasty
           orthopedic surgeons from their osteoarthritis clinic at St-Mary's hospital.

        -  Prospective patients interested will be referred to the interventional radiology clinic
           at the MUHC for discussion of the procedures and of the study and recruitment.

        -  Consent will be obtained from all patients.

        -  Patients who accept to participate and fit the criteria will be randomized to receive
           either the embolization procedure, the nerve ablation procedure or a sham procedure.
           They will fill out the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)
           and osteoarthritis knee and hip quality of life questionnaire (OAKHQOL) questionnaires
           as well the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain which will serve as baseline.

        -  They will then be contacted by the appropriate service to schedule the procedure.

        -  All embolization or nerve ablation procedures will be performed by either a qualified
           interventional radiologist or anesthetist.

      Patients will be informed that they will not know which procedure they will receive. A
      barrier will be placed to shield them from visualizing the procedure and, for both procedures
      and sham procedure, skin freezing, and post-procedural bandages will be applied to the groin
      and in the skin around the knee. The patients will be informed that the procedures can take
      similar time between 15 minutes and 1 hr and that timing is variable between patients. They
      will also be informed that pain sensation around the knee can be similar between procedures.
      For all procedures, a written scenario (words and manipulations of the skin) will be followed
      such that all patients have the impression they are getting the same thing despite some
      having only the sham, others the embolization, and others the denervation. At the end of all
      procedures, patients will be transferred to the recovery room as per routine for
      interventional radiology procedures. Recovery room nurses will not know which of the
      procedures the patient had. They will be informed to look out for possible complications from
      either procedure. Patients will be informed that they must remain with their legs still for
      3hrs after the procedure to prevent bleeding from the possible puncture in the artery that is
      necessary for the embolization procedure. No procedure specific technical discussion
      regarding the procedure will occur during the procedures to suggest what was done, only the
      common scenario will be followed. All this will be done in an attempt to blind the patient as
      much as possible. Blinding will be lifted for once the patient has completed the study. There
      is a final questionnaire to be filled out by the patient and physician at which point the
      patient will be informed of what procedure they received.

        -  The patients will be offered IV analgesia using midazolam and fentanyl during the
           procedure at regular intervals and the patients will be left to decide if they think it
           is necessary or not.

        -  Analgesics will be provided as per set orders during the recovery period in the
           post-procedural recovery room. Pain scales and medications provided are routinely
           registered in Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) documents and this data will be collected

        -  The patient will be discharged home with standard prescriptions for 2-3 days of
           post-procedural home analgesics and then will restart their routine pain control regimen
           they have been using.

        -  After the procedure, while at home, the patient will fill out paper or on-line
           confidential surveys (only study number on the survey, no patient identifying
           information) of routine medications used, WOMAC questionnaires and a VAS at regular
           interval (1d, 1wk, 2wks, 1m, 2m, 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m and if the patient has surgery at 1wk,
           2wk, 1m, 2m, and 3m post-surgery). In addition, the OAKHQOL questionnaire will be filled
           out at 1m, 6m, and 12m and if the patient has surgery a 3m after surgery. The patients
           will be contacted by phone to make sure they remember to fill these out at the correct
           intervals. If they have chosen to use the paper forms, they will be collected in a
           pre-stamped envelope to send back to us at the 12m mark.

        -  A patient will be considered to have completed the study after 12m without knee surgery
           or 3m after a knee replacement surgery, whichever occurs first.

        -  Data will be gathered, stored, and analyzed.

        -  Data collected will include demographics, relevant medical history, vital signs, which
           procedure was performed, as well as the use of IV and oral analgesics, visual analog
           pain scores (VAS), WOMAC, and OAKHQOL questionnaires, X-rays performed during routine
           follow-ups at the orthopedic surgery clinic will be graded as per International Knee
           Documentation Committee (IKDC) grading system.

        -  Other than the initial visit aimed at getting consent and randomizing the patients and
           the procedures themselves, any research specific patient encounters scheduled in this
           study will be done by phone, unless the patient requests otherwise.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the objective (urodynamic) cure rates and effect on
      patient quality of life after six months of treatment for two different nonsurgical
      management options for genuine stress urinary incontinence in females: weighted vaginal cones
      and formal supervised pelvic floor physiotherapy with biofeedback.

      Hypothesis: Assuming a minimum of six months of treatment, weighted vaginal cones are as
      effective as a formal supervised program of pelvic floor physiotherapy with biofeedback for
      the treatment of uncomplicated genuine stress urinary incontinence in females.
    ",Weighted Vaginal Cones Versus Biofeedback in the Treatment of Urodynamic Stress Incontinence: a Randomized Trial.,"Urinary Incontinence, Stress","['Urinary Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence, Stress', 'Body Weight']","
      Background and Rationale Urinary incontinence is a widespread and debilitating medical
      problem, with an estimated prevalence of between 17-45% in adult women. Genuine stress
      incontinence is the most common form of urinary incontinence in women, with objective
      diagnosis made via urodynamics. Urinary continence is maintained when the urethral resistance
      (pressure) is greater than the intravesical pressure. Genuine stress incontinence occurs when
      pressure transmission to the urethra is compromised by poor anatomic support of the proximal
      urethra resulting from weakened pelvic floor musculature and/or defective endopelvic fascia.
      While the gold standard for treatment of genuine stress incontinence is still considered to
      be surgical, there is renewed interest among both patients and surgeons for nonsurgical
      (conservative) management. The goal of conservative therapy is to restrengthen and retrain
      the pelvic floor muscles to improve urethral pressure transmission and thus improve the
      continence mechanism.

      Nonsurgical therapies include PFME with or without biofeedback, and weighted vaginal cones.
      PFME with biofeedback are widely accepted as an effective conservative treatment for genuine
      stress incontinence, with subjective cure rates estimated to be as high as 70 percent.
      However, to date, objective cure rates as defined by urodynamics have not been well
      documented. Similarly, while limited studies suggest that vaginal cone therapy results in a
      subjective cure rate of 60%, objective cure rates still have not been determined. With
      growing clinic and surgical waiting lists and rising hospital costs, weighted vaginal cones,
      if objectively proven to be a comparably effective alternative to physiotherapy, will offer
      an effective management option for stress incontinence, thus, perhaps avoiding referral to a
      tertiary hospital for physiotherapy, and surgery.

      We hypothesize that following a minimum of six months of treatment, weighted vaginal cones
      would be as effective as a formal supervised program of pelvic floor physiotherapy with
      biofeedback for the treatment of uncomplicated genuine stress urinary incontinence in
      females. We are thus seeking to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial.

      Method

      An estimated 60 women identified from ambulatory clinics with multichannel urodynamics
      documenting genuine stress urinary incontinence will be needed to participate in this
      single-blind, randomized pilot study. Once entered, patients will be randomized to receive
      one of two different nonsurgical treatments: PFME with biofeedback or weighted vaginal cones.
      The patients will chart compliance to treatment for the duration of the study. A quality of
      life questionnaire will be completed at the beginning and end of the trial, along with a
      subjective assessment of incontinence severity via a standardized questionnaire. The study
      period will be six months. Upon completion of the study, patients will undergo repeat
      multichannel urodynamics and perineal pad testing to determine if genuine stress incontinence
      is present or absent and thus whether objective cure has been achieved. Results will be
      analyzed and compared statistically.

      TITLE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT A randomized, double-blind controlled trial of bupivacaine
      extended-release liposome injection for post-surgical analgesia in patients undergoing
      open-reduction internal fixation of the distal radius.

      PROJECT SUMMARY For patients undergoing open-reduction internal-fixaton (ORIF) of isolated
      distal radius fractures, administration of 66.5 mg of liposomal bupivacaine to operative
      field may decrease the need for post-operative narcotic pain medication.

      STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Patients undergoing open-reduction internal-fixation (ORIF) of
      isolated distal radius fractures experience significant post-operative pain, most commonly
      mitigated by the use of narcotic painkillers. Among other issues, prolonged use of narcotic
      painkillers can lead to dependence and abuse. This potentially leads to post-operative
      narcotic seeking habits of adult orthopedic trauma patients.

      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK There is much research supporting that administration of liposomal
      bupivacaine is an effective post-surgical analgesic. The investigators' hypothesis is that
      66.5 mg of liposomal bupivacaine injected at the operative field will decrease the need for
      post-operative narcotics, and will therefore reduce the risk of dependence and abuse.

      RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

      -Assess the potential benefit of single-dose liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) in the treatment
      of post-operative pain following open-reduction internal-fixation of isolated distal radius
      fractures.

      METHODOLOGY Patients admitted to University of Louisville Hospital with isolated distal
      radius fractures requiring ORIF will be eligible. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: 1)
      patients who have received narcotic pain medication within the past 6 months as confirmed by
      Kasper reporting 2) Patients compartment syndrome or acute carpal tunnel syndrome requiring
      surgical decompression 3) Patients with prior history of ipsilateral wrist surgery.

      Randomization will be performed using sealed envelopes, and each patient will be assigned a
      number that corresponds to either an Exparel 266mg solution (20 ml Exparel 1.3% plus 40ml of
      injectable saline) verses a 60ml placebo control injection (20ml inert liposomal suspension
      used in the manufacturing of Exparel without bupivacaine plus 40ml injectable saline) to be
      provided by Pacira. If inert liposomal solution is not a viable option, blinded/opaque
      syringes (either provided by Pacira (preferable ) or created by unblinded personnel) will be
      used to dispense 60 mL of sterile saline. The corresponding solution will be known to the
      participating, unblinded pharmacists who will provide the solutions and keep participant
      records, and not to the surgeons.

      The amount of narcotic pain medication used in the recovery room and during the hospital
      admission will be recorded. Patients will also be provided study logs to record their daily
      usage of prescribed pain medication once discharge home. Follow-up phone calls will be made
      to each patient 72 hours post-operatively, and the amount of narcotic tablets used will be
      recorded. Patients will then be seen in the clinic 1 week postoperatively, and the total
      narcotic pain medication usage will again be documented. Passive wrist range of motion (ROM)
      tolerance and overall satisfaction will also be assessed at this visit. Demographic data
      including age, gender and handedness will be recorded for each patient. The primary outcome
      measure will be the total post-operative narcotic pain medication use. Secondary outcome
      measures will be passive wrist ROM, and overall satisfaction.

      All subjects will be treated ethically. This includes true informed consent, explanation of
      the study by a co-investigator, and time to ask questions about the study. Patient intake
      data will be kept on paper forms initially and kept in a desk behind a locked research office
      in the department of orthopaedics that is accessible only to staff. This data will be entered
      into a password protected computer in the same office and the papers will then be shredded.
      Once feasible, all PHI will be removed from the data set. A key for the PHI will be in a
      separate excel file on this same computer.

      PLAN FOR ANALYSIS OF RESULTS To detect a 30% difference in narcotic pain medication
      requirement, a Cohen's d = 0.4 (small/medium effect) will be required.

      TIMETABLE The study will begin once IRB approval is obtained and will continue for 1 year.

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by premature death mainly because of
      progressive and severe right ventricular failure. Target drugs are reported to be associated
      with significant improvement of clinical outcome for PAH patients. However, previous studies
      using those target drugs focused on the change of 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and or
      hemodynamic responses. As 6MWD has weak correlation with clinical outcome (time to clinical
      worsening, TTCW), benefits from target drugs for PAH patients are not clear. We previously
      reported the safety and efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) for treatment of PAH
      patients who were unresponsive to target drugs. Hence, we design the randomized study to
      identify the effect of PADN on PAH.
    ",A Study to Investigate the Efficacy of PADN to Improved Functional Capacity and Hemodynamics in Patients With PAH,Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"['Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension', 'Hypertension']","
      The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      compare the effect of PADN on PAH patients. Based on the previous studies, the rate of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-related event was around 30% after 6-month treatment
      using target drugs. And our previous data showed that this PAH-related event at 6-month after
      PADN procedure was 15%. As a result, a total of 270 PAH patients was required, with 135
      patients/per group at a ratio of 1:1 randomization. All patients underwent an 18F-DOPA PET/CT
      scan of pulmonary arteries and the heart, performed at basement.

      We will study the effects of ondansetron on measurements of electrical activity in the heart
      to make sure doses we are using to prevent nausea and vomiting in children receiving
      chemotherapy are safe.
    ",Heart Safety Study of Ondansetron in Children Receiving Chemotherapy,Malignant Childhood Neoplasm,Neoplasms,"
      Children receiving chemotherapy for cancer at the Jimmy Everest Center for Cancer and Blood
      Disorders in Children also often receive an IV dose of an antiemetic for prophylaxis. The
      most common antiemetics used are in the family of 5HT3 antagonists, specifically granisetron
      and ondansetron. Prior to a recent recommendation by the FDA, we have used ondansetron 0.45
      mg/kg IV. Based on adult ECG data, the recommended dose of ondansetron has been changed to no
      greater than 0.15 mg/kg. We have prior studies showing that the bigger dose is better at
      preventing nausea and vomiting. Therefore we are studying ECG data in patients receiving
      ondansetron and chemotherapy. Each subject will have two identical cycles of chemotherapy.
      Prior to the first of the two cycles they will be randomized to receive one of two doses of
      ondansetron with the first cycle and the other dose with the second cycle. The two doses are
      the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg and a higher dose of 0.3 mg/kg. The dose level the patient
      receives each cycle will be blinded to the investigator and the subject.

      Prior to the first dose of investigational ondansetron, the patient will have an ECG. This
      ECG will be repeated 30 minutes after the ondansetron is administered and just before
      chemotherapy administration, and repeated again 30 minutes later. The change in the QTc
      intervals will be calculated by two independent pediatric cardiologists who are also blinded
      to the ondansetron dose level received. This process will be repeated with the next course of
      chemotherapy, with the second dose of ondansetron. Our goal is to see if there is an
      appreciable difference between the two doses in the QTc interval changes they induce.

      Based on laboratory studies, donepezil will improve pain relief more than placebo in patients
      with chronic neuropathic pain who are currently taking gabapentin or pregabalin.
    ",Donepezil Compared to Placebo in Patients With Chronic Neuropathic Pain,Neuropathic Pain,Neuralgia,"
      Investigators are currently examining in the laboratory the mechanisms which lead to
      sprouting of noradrenergic fibers in the spinal cord in models of chronic pain as well as the
      mechanisms that lead to a novel noradrenergic - cholinergic circuit in the spinal cord. In
      addition to examining the circumstances which generate this increased capacity for analgesia
      and the mechanisms by which they occur, investigators will test in this protocol whether
      approved and experimental treatments for neuropathic pain exploit this increased capacity.

      This study is in patients with neuropathic pain taking gabapentin or pregabalin, and will
      test the clinical relevance of these preclinical data by comparing placebo to the
      cholinesterase inhibitor. Investigators focus not only on mechanistic hypotheses in the
      laboratory studies, but also on practical applications, using clinically approved drugs,
      including gabapentin and pregabalin to activate noradrenergic activity and donepezil
      (Aricept®), approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia, but not previously tested to
      treat neuropathic pain, to inhibit cholinesterase. Each of these drugs may act by mechanisms
      in addition to those involved in descending noradrenergic inhibition, but investigators
      hypothesize that the therapeutic strength of their combination relies heavily on this cascade
      engendered by noradrenergic sprouting and altered α2-adrenoceptor function. The proposed
      studies will provide critical tests of this hypothesis and critical information to guide more
      effective clinical therapy of neuropathic pain.

      The study is a prospective, randomized, open-label comparison of a multimodal regimen and a
      standard, narcotic-based regimen for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing
      surgery for an operatively indicated, isolated extremity fracture. The investigators will be
      measuring pain levels, narcotic use, patient satisfaction, patient reported function, adverse
      events and fracture union. The investigators hypothesize that this multimodal regimen will
      lead to improved pain, less narcotic use and improved satisfaction as compared to the
      standard regimen.

      Patients will be assessed for inclusion or exclusion during admission to the hospital or
      during evaluation in the clinic or emergency room for an isolated extremity fracture for
      which surgery is indicated. Once enrolled in the study and consent obtained, patients will be
      randomized into either the standard therapy group or the multimodal therapy group using
      permuted block randomization based on injury site. The sites of fracture are as follows:

        -  wrist/hand/forearm

        -  elbow/upper arm/shoulder

        -  acetabulum/pelvis

        -  foot/ankle

        -  patella/tibia (shaft, proximal)

        -  femur (proximal to distal)

      The investigators have assumed that these distinct areas result in a similar amount of
      disability and pain as compared to the other sites. This is an attempt to mitigate the
      possible confounder of disproportionate numbers of more painful or more debilitating injuries
      falling in one study group compared to another.

      Pre-operatively, patient demographic data will be recording including age, gender, BMI, hand
      dominance, occupation, use of tobacco/alcohol/illicit drugs, use of assistive devices,
      relevant comorbidities (i.e., diabetes), site of injury, mechanism and energy (high or low).
      If there is to be a delay between initial presentation and surgery, as is often the case for
      distal radius or ankle fractures, among others, multimodal patients will begin their therapy
      immediately after evaluation. Thus, they will be started on scheduled 1000mg acetaminophen
      and 100mg gabapentin both three times daily. They will also be provided an 5mg oxycodone
      prescription with instructions to take 1-3 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain. Standard
      therapy patients will be prescribed oxycodone alone, using the same parameters, with the
      ability to take acetaminophen on an as needed basis.

      Pre-operatively, multimodal patients will receive 1000mg IV acetaminophen, 100mg PO
      gabapentin and 400mg PO celecoxib. All patients will have a peripheral nerve block placed
      when indicated, to confirm to the investigators standard of care. Patients will then undergo
      surgery with the investigators standardized anesthesia protocol as described in the protocol.
      Intraoperatively, multimodal patients will receive 8mg of IV dexamethasone. Post-operatively,
      multimodal patients will be given 1000mg acetaminophen three times daily for the duration of
      their narcotic use and 100mg Gabapentin three times daily for 1 week, which will be titrated
      to 200mg three times daily for 1 additional week. They will also receive an oxycodone
      prescription as described previously. Standard therapy patients will be given an oxycodone
      prescription alone with the advice to take tylenol on an as needed basis not to exceed
      4000mg/day. No placebo medications will be used as this is an open label study.

      Patients will be instructed to avoid all anti-inflammatory medications. All patients across
      groups will be given aspirin 81mg for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis if they suffered a
      lower extremity fracture. Should a patient require an alternative deep vein thrombosis
      prophylaxis regimen due to an allergy to aspirin or a personal history of deep vein
      thromboses, low molecular weight heparin will be used.

      Patients will be given a diary to record their daily narcotic use, daily minimum, maximum and
      average pain scores using a visual analog scale and any side effects. Patients will be
      provided the contact information of the attending surgeon's nurse to report any serious
      allergies or adverse effects of the study medications. A case by case decision will be made
      to either continue the protocol or to drop the patient from the study and make needed
      medications changes.

      Patients will be followed at defined time points after surgery including, 2 wks, 6wks, 3mo
      and 6mo.

      At their 2 wk follow up visit they will fill out the Short Musculoskeletal Function
      Assessment for their preoperative functional state as well as the American Pain Society
      Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. These will again be filled out at their 3 and 6 month
      visits. Union will be assessed at their 3 and 6 month visits by a third party, blinded
      observed. It will be defined as three cortices of bridging callus on 2 orthogonal views. Once
      fracture union occurs or nonunion is identified control patients will be allowed to use non
      steroidal anti-inflammatories as needed. Time to return to work/normal activity, total
      narcotic usage and duration of narcotic use will also be recorded.

      Per the EAST practice management guidelines, an open fracture is defined as one in which the
      fracture fragments communicate with the environment through a break in the skin. The presence
      of an open fracture, either isolated or as part of a multiple injury complex, increases the
      risk of infection and soft tissue complications. Open fractures are further classified into
      Grade I - Grade III fractures per the Gustilo Classification. Grade III fractures are those
      with the highest likelihood of contamination and infection with infection rates ranging from
      10% to 42%.

      EAST guidelines currently recommend systemic gram positive coverage for all open fractures
      with the addition of gram negative coverage for all Grade III fractures. Antibiotics should

      Traditionally, patients received the combination of Cefazolin and Gentamicin as the preferred
      prophylactic antibiotic regimen, despite the need for multiple antibiotics and the risk of
      nephrotoxicity associated with aminoglycosides. Whether there is clinically a more ideal
      prophylactic antibiotic available remains to be seen. This proposed research initiative is
      intended to evaluate several antibiotic regimens with similar spectrums of activity to see if
      there is an equally effective single agent with minimal nephrotoxicity associated with its
      use. In selecting the study antibiotics to be utilized in the protocol, available information
      was obtained regarding timing of antibiotics, organisms identified by culture results, and
      any studies available on specific antibiotic regimens. In regards to timing, there is
      evidence to support that time to antibiotics and time to the operating room may be more
      important than the particular antibiotic itself. Additionally, a recent study from 2015
      looked at the organisms identified from culture results for Grade I through Grade III
      fractures in Germany. The vast majority of cultures obtained were gram positive organisms,
      even in the Grade III fractures, and included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus
      aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, various Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecium and
      Corynebacterium. Interestingly, the only gram negative organism identified in the study was
      Escherichia coli. Lastly, when trying to identify antibiotic specific studies, a recent study
      was identified looking at Ceftriaxone as the agent of choice, while limiting the use of
      vancomycin and aminoglycosides. The conclusion of the study showed a significant decrease in
      vancomycin and aminoglycosides administered with no increase in infection rates.

      Here at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, the investigator's current trauma and orthopedics
      practice management guideline has been reviewed and changed multiple times in the past
      several years. For the vast majority of time, the recommendation has been to use the
      traditional cefazolin/gentamicin combination. However, several cases of nephrotoxicity led to
      some hesitation in utilizing this regimen. Therefore, for a short time period,
      piperacillin/tazobactam was being used for all Grade III fractures instead. At present
      however, due to conflicting concerns regarding antimicrobial stewardship with utilizing broad
      spectrum piperacillin/tazobactam with the nephrotoxicity concerns of gentamicin, the approved
      guideline utilizes cefazolin/gentamicin for patients under 65 years of age and
      piperacillin/tazobactam for all patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age. This study
      aims to evaluate non-inferiority of ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftriaxone, and
      piperacillin/tazobactam when compared to the traditional regimen of cefazolin/gentamicin for
      grade III open fractures.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurs mainly in the elderly and has important
      comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular, which increase its severity. Chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease affects 5% of people globally, increasing to 10% in the elderly. According
      to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), there were 384 million cases of COPD in
      2010, with a global prevalence of 12% (www.who.int). Deaths due to COPD are 3 million/year
      globally (GOLD 2018) and >20,000/year in Italy.

      The investigator speculated that multimorbid elderly COPD patients recently hospitalized due
      to an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and who have concomitant cardiovascular disease may
      have fewer re-hospitalizations and increased survival in the following year if treated with
      LABD+ICS rather than with LABD alone.

      The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of currently recommended and

      Ventral hernia repair may be associated with significant postoperative pain. Pain is
      typically managed with intravenous (IV) and oral medications that come with their own risks,
      such as nausea, constipation, sedation, respiratory depression, increased bleeding, and/or
      kidney or liver dysfunction. The quadratus lumborum peripheral nerve block has been shown to
      produce anesthesia of the anterior abdominal wall in the T7 to L1 distribution. This study
      aims to evaluate if the addition of the quadratus lumborum peripheral nerve block (QLB) can
      improve pain scores, decrease the need for IV and oral pain medications, and/or speed the
      patients' return to normal activity.
    ",Impact of Quadratus Lumborum Block on Recovery Profile After Ventral Hernia Repair,"['Pain, Postoperative', 'Opioid Use']","['Hernia', 'Pain, Postoperative', 'Hernia, Ventral']","
      Current trends in perioperative pain management stress the importance of multimodal analgesia
      in an effort to reduce the dependence on opioid pain medications. Adverse effects of opioids
      include sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, itching, and, most
      importantly, the potential for tolerance and abuse. Multimodal analgesia attempts to utilize
      multiple techniques, including medications and nerve block procedures, to improve
      postoperative analgesia. Improved postoperative pain control can enable an earlier return to
      normal activities for patients, not only improving patient satisfaction, but also reducing
      postoperative morbidity and adverse effects of opioids.

      Approximately 350,000 to 500,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed each year in the United
      States. Surgeries completed laparoscopically are typically performed on an outpatient basis,
      allowing patients to return home the same day of surgery and treat their pain independently
      with prescribed pain medications. Utilization of a regional anesthesia technique may allow
      prolonged numbing of the nerves postoperatively and decrease the reliance on oral pain
      medications. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have been shown to decrease pain scores
      and opioid consumption following ventral hernia repair. Quadratus lumborum (QL) blocks are
      newer iterations of the TAP block.

      There are currently three types of the QL block, all targeting the thoracolumbar fascia
      surrounding the quadratus lumborum muscle. Injection within this fascial plane may allow
      local anesthetic spread into the paravertebral space, possibly explaining why QL blocks have
      been mapped from the T7 to T12/L1 dermatomes, covering the entire abdomen. Conversely, TAP
      blocks have been mapped from the T10 to T12/L1 dermatomes, only covering the abdomen below
      the umbilicus. In the first, the Quadratus lumborum 1 block (QL1), the local anesthetic is
      injected within the fascial plane lateral to the QL muscle. In the second, the Quadratus
      lumborum 2 block (QL2), the needle trajectory is more superficial, and the local anesthetic
      is injected along the posterior border of the QL muscle. The third iteration, the Quadratus
      lumborum 3 block (QL3), involves a deeper, transmuscular approach with injection along the
      anterior border of the QL muscle. Our study would utilize the QL2 approach as the dermatomal
      distribution of the QL1 and QL2 blocks appear to be more widespread than the QL3 block, and
      the QL2 block may be a safer approach due to the more superficial angle of the needle 3.

      Additionally, the QL block has been shown to have a longer duration of analgesia when
      directly compared to the TAP block. A study of pediatric lower abdominal surgery revealed
      improved pain scores and parent satisfaction with care in the QL group compared to TAP block.
      This improvement persisted to the 24 hour mark. In a study of postoperative pain following
      cesarean delivery, pain scores were improved and opioid consumption decreased with the QL
      block compared to the TAP block. The differences were not significant at the 1 and 6 hour
      marks, but were significant at the 12, 24 and 48 hour marks, highlighting the analgesic
      duration of the QL block 8.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the QL block using the QL2 approach on recovery
      profile after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, a commonly performed surgery, as well as
      contribute to the understanding of the block and its distribution of anesthesia.

      Each participant will receive both treatments. During the first IVF/ICSI cycle, the luteal
      phase will be supplemented with subcutaneous progesterone (S) or vaginal progesterone (V). At

      satisfaction will be administered and filled in by the patient during the waiting time and
      always before the knowledge of the result. This practical organization allows the elimination
      of emotional biases correlated with the outcome. In case of a negative beta-hCG, the patient
      will be scheduled for a second IVF/ICSI cycle after a washout (W) period (between 2 and 6
      months). In the second cycle, the patient will undergo, during the luteal phase, the opposite

      will be administered on the day of beta-hCG, with the same modalities of the first cycle. The
      domains of the surveys are focused on facility of the administration, comfort, level of

      Chronic sinus infections (chronic sinusitis or CRS) are common conditions that affect
      millions of Americans. While this is a common disorder, medical treatments for this condition
      vary a lot and little is known how and why different treatments work in some individuals and
      not in others. Some physicians commonly utilize a course of oral steroid therapy similar to
      treatment of inflammatory conditions including asthma and arthritis. Other physicians feel
      that oral steroids are not more effective than nasal steroid sprays in reducing inflammation
      and prefer prescribing nasal steroids. There is no conclusive data as to whether oral or
      sprayed nasal steroids are more effective in providing long-term benefit to patients. Nasal
      steroids are FDA approved to treat some types of chronic sinusitis but oral steroids are FDA
      approved medications that are used to treat inflammatory conditions but is not specifically
      indicated for chronic sinusitis and thus should be regarded as investigational drug. The
      purpose of this research study is to better understand whether orally administered steroids
      results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed steroids. The investigators

    ",ACTHAR Therapy for Central Nervous System Sarcoidosis,Sarcoidosis,Sarcoidosis,"
      Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is one of the most severe manifestations of
      sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis affecting the leptomeninges, spinal cord, or brain parenchyma
      portends a difficult course and frequently results in severe disability or death (1).
      Treatment of moderate and severe CNS sarcoidosis typically involves a combination of
      corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents such as methotrexate (2). Unfortunately, most response
      rates are reportedly only in the 29-38% range for corticosteroids alone, and the effects of
      cytotoxic agents in sarcoidosis require up to 6 months to occur. A typical scenario is that
      patients are treated for prolonged periods with high dose glucocorticoids with suboptimal
      effectiveness despite development of substantial toxicities. Some series report that
      cyclophosphamide or infliximab may be beneficial (3), but these approaches are limited by
      potentially severe toxicities, loss of effectiveness, or payor constraints.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of albiglutide and exenatide on
      gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA), gastric emptying (GE) and nausea (as measured by visual
      analogue scale [VAS]) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study is divided
      in two parts. Part A will characterize the GMA, GE and nausea response to exenatide and
      confirm exenatide as a positive control for Part B. Part B will compare the effects of
      albiglutide and exenatide on GMA, GE and nausea.

      Part A is a single arm, open-label design and all subjects will receive 10 microgram (mcg)
      subcutaneous exenatide twice daily for 5 days. This part will comprise 3 study periods: a
      3-week screening/wash-out, 5-day treatment, and follow-up (within 7 days after the last dose
      of exenatide). The total duration of a subject's participation in Part A will be
      approximately 5 weeks. Once Part A is complete, data will be reviewed and a decision to
      progress to Part B will be made.

      In Part B, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either albiglutide (starting dose of 30
      milligrams [mg] once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg once weekly for 4 weeks) or
      exenatide (starting dose of 5 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks, followed by 10 mcg twice daily for
      4 weeks). The total duration of a subject's participation in the study will be approximately
      15 weeks.

      Ciclopirox olamine (Ciclochem®) is a pyridone broad spectrum antifungal drug which has shown
      activity on dermatophytes, yeasts, moulds, actinomycetes and some bacteria. Its mechanism of
      action is based on a fungicidal activity by inhibiting the cellular captation of essential
      substances needed for the metabolism and growth of the fungi. On the other hand, this drug
      binds irreversibly with cell structures as mitochondria, ribosomes, microsomes and cell wall.
      After dermal application, Ciclopirox olamine undergoes skin penetration, being only absorbed
      a 1,5% of the applied dose. Clinical efficacy has been studied in patients above 10 years
      with superficial dermatomycoses (dermatophytoses, candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor) and
      the percentage of clinical healing ranged from 77% to 91% after 2-4 weeks of twice a day
      topical application. In all the studies, the safety profile has been very good, showing only
      a very low rate of adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. There are very few previous
      available data on the application of this compound in children under 10 years of age. A
      single study had been performed with a solution formulation in patients from 6 to 29 months
      with diaper candidiasis, showing good efficacy and tolerability in these patients. The
      present study aims to show the safety and tolerability of ciclopirox olamine in a cream
      formulation in patients from 3 months to 10 years with dermatomycoses.

      In August of 2014, the FDA approved ELELYSO for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
      for pediatric subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease. The recommended
      dosage for treatment-naïve adult and pediatric subjects 4 years of age and older is 60 units
      per kg of body weight administered every other week as a 60 to 120 minute intravenous
      infusion. As a postmarketing commitment, the Sponsor agreed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) in pediatric subjects
      with Type 1 Gaucher Disease. in at least 5 subjects with body weight less than 15 kg; at

      This study (B3031003) is an open-label study in pediatric subjects with Type 1 Gaucher
      Disease to characterize PK, PD and safety following an infusion of taliglucerase alfa in at
      least 5 subjects with body weight less than 15 kg; at least 5 subjects with body weight 15 to
      less than 20 kg; and at least 5 subjects with body weight of 20-25 kg. The PK sample
      collection will take approximately 4 hours to complete and will be performed one month or up
      to 6 months after the subject's first taliglucerase infusion in the registry study. The
      subject will be contacted the day after the PK samples are collected to assess any continuing
      or new adverse events and to review the subject's concomitant medications. Body weight at the
      time of the PK blood draw will determine the weight category for each subject. Subjects
      enrolled into the study will be assigned the same unique subject number assigned to them in
      the registry study (B3031002). This will allow linkage to relevant data from the registry
      study for analysis in this study.

      For the purposes of this study, baseline evaluations will be obtained from the registry study
      and must be performed prior to the subject's first dose of taliglucerase alfa. The Month 6
      and Month 12 evaluations will be performed 6 months and 12 months after the start of
      taliglucerase alfa treatment, respectively.

      Subjects will be eligible for the PK study (B3031003) only if the PD assessments (spleen
      volume/size, hemoglobin/platelet counts and height/weight measurements) immunogenicity data
      and Gaucher disease diagnostic history are available from the registry study baseline visit
      and prior to the start of taliglucerase alfa treatment. If liver volume/size is available, it
      will also be analyzed but is not necessary for eligibility for the PK study.

      Pediatric subjects prescribed 60 units/kg of taliglucerase alfa every other week by their
      physician will be recruited from the registry study. Subjects can be screened for the PK
      study at the same time as they are enrolled into the registry study (ERT treatment-naïve
      subjects) or up to 6 months after they are enrolled into the registry study (previously ERT
      naïve subjects) if PD assessments (spleen volume/size, hemoglobin/platelet counts and
      height/weight measurements), immunogenicity data and Gaucher disease diagnostic history
      (residual enzyme activity and genotype data) were performed at baseline of the registry study
      and prior to the start of taliglucerase alfa treatment.

      Baseline data from the registry study for PD and immunogenicity testing are defined as PD
      measurements (spleen volume/size, liver volume/size (if available), hemoglobin and platelet
      counts and growth measures), Gaucher disease diagnostic history and immunogenicity samples
      that were collected at entry into the registry study and prior to the start of taliglucerase
      alfa treatment.

      For the secondary PD endpoints, spleen volume/size and liver volume/size (if available) will
      be measured using MRI, CT or ultrasound, whichever is the standard of care according to the
      investigator. The method used to measure spleen and liver volume/size at Baseline will be the
      same one used at Month 12. Change from Baseline and percent change from Baseline at Month 12
      of registry study will be calculated for spleen volume, liver volume (if available),
      hemoglobin and platelet counts, and growth measures (height, weight and Z-scores).

      For each subject enrolled in this study, safety data while on taliglucerase alfa, starting
      from the baseline visit (entry into the registry study) and continuing until 28 days after
      the Month 12 PD data collection visit, will be obtained for reporting.

      Safety assessments for the study will include collection of all adverse event and serious
      adverse event data, including serious hypersensitivity reactions, procedures for
      immunogenicity testing (ie, detection and titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies and
      detection of IgE antibodies) as well as vital signs taken as standard of care during
      infusions. A pre-dose blood sample for testing of antidrug antibodies (ADA) on the day of PK
      Sample Visit will be collected in an effort to assess the impact of immunogenicity on PK.

      This is a phase 4, open-label, feasibility study of extended release naltrexone (Vivitrol,
      Alkermes Pharmaceutical) and case management for treatment of alcohol use disorders in the
      ED.

      Excess alcohol use is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and contributes to a large
      number of emergency department (ED) visits. The rate of alcohol-related ED visits is
      increasing, and there is evidence that this increase may be driven by a subset of patients
      who frequently visit the ED due to an underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). The proposed
      study will assess the feasibility of implementing a multimodal treatment for AUD in the
      emergency department for 25 patients with AUD. The rationale for including each component of
      the multimodal treatment is outlined below.

      Pharmacotherapy is recommended as the standard of care for alcohol use disorders. Of the four
      drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of alcohol use disorder, extended release naltrexone
      has been found to be superior at reducing healthcare utilization, increasing detoxification
      facility use, and reducing total cost. Fewer than 1 in 4 patients with AUD currently receives
      treatment with an FDA approved agent and use of these drugs in EDs is virtually non-existent.

      ED patients with alcohol use disorders frequently suffer from multiple medical, mental
      health, and social problems that influence their health. Providing such patients with case
      management services has shown promise in improving health related outcomes while curbing ED
      utilization and healthcare costs.

      Regardless of comorbidity, limited access to substance use and mental health services is a
      significant barrier to receiving treatment, and large disparities exist in access based on
      income level. Facilitated referrals, where a healthcare worker communicates with the patient
      and service providers and assists the patient with obtaining follow up, have been used
      effectively to improve access to specialty care after ED discharge. Case managers are
      familiar with community treatment resources and are well versed in providing facilitated
      referrals.

      The primary hypothesis is that implementing this multimodal treatment will be feasible in an
      ED setting and will reduce alcohol use. Feasibility measures (recruitment, retention,
      continuation of treatment after the trial) are the primary outcomes. The intent of the
      intervention is to change drinking behavior in a way that benefits participants' health and
      quality of life. As such, we will conduct a limited efficacy assessment. Treatment efficacy
      will be assessed by comparing alcohol consumption, quality of life, and life consequences
      related to alcohol use before and after the intervention.

      The primary efficacy outcome is change in total alcohol consumption measured by a 2 week
      timeline follow back. Change from baseline will be assessed after the 3 month intervention
      period, and at the conclusion of the study follow up period for all outcomes.

      The title of this acute, open-label pilot study is ""Controlled Release Melatonin (Melatonin
      CR) for the treatment of impaired sleep maintenance (ISM) in 4-8 year old children with
      autism spectrum disorders (ASD)."" Maintenance of sleep is a significant challenge in the
      treatment of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities including ASDs. Night awakening or
      early morning waking can have detrimental effects on these children's daytime behavior and
      the functioning of their household. Sleep problems in the ASD population are generally
      managed first with behavioral interventions and, when these are not successful, pharmacologic
      therapy. Most medications effect sleep onset and not sleep maintenance. This study
      investigates the effectiveness of Melatonin CR for managing ISM in 4-8 year old children with
      ASD. Twenty patients will be recruited from the Developmental/Behavioral Pediatrics Clinic at
      the Munroe Meyer Institute at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Inclusion criteria
      are male and female children ages 4-8 years with a diagnosis of an ASD, including Pervasive
      Developmental Disorder NOS (PDD, NOS), Asperger's Syndrome, or Autistic Disorder,
      parent/guardian consent for participation, stable psychotropic medication treatment for at
      least 4 weeks, and a documented history of ISM based on parent-report, somnolog and Child
      Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and a clinician rating of ≥4 (moderately ill) on the
      Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale. Patients will be excluded if they have
      been treated with Melatonin or Melatonin CR in the past month, failed treatment with
      Melatonin CR, or if they have a previously un-evaluated medical condition which may be
      causing the ISM. Following the completion of a somnolog and standardized questionnaires, the
      patients will be treated for 10-14 days with melatonin CR. Somnologs will be completed during
      treatment, and standardized parent questionnaires, CGI-S, and adverse event collection will
      be repeated at the end of Melatonin CR therapy. Response will be defined as a Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 (much or very much improved). These will be
      compared to baseline ratings. Following the completion of the study protocol, all patients
      will continue to be followed in the Developmental Pediatrics clinic. Data from this acute
      pilot trial can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of a larger study to determine
      optimal therapy for patients with ASD and ISM.

      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) from explosions is the ""signature injury"" of Veterans who
      have deployed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although the immediate effects of a single
      mTBI usually resolve over days or weeks, multiple mTBIs can lead to both persistent symptoms
      and, years later, to two fatal progressive brain diseases, chronic traumatic encephalopathy
      (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is believed that CTE and AD are caused by nerve
      damaging chemicals called tau and beta amyloid produced by the brain but which are not
      removed from the brain in a normal manner in persons with mTBIs. The investigators will
      determine in Veterans who experienced mTBIs whether a clinically available drug called
      prazosin increases removal of tau and beta amyloid from the brain. This will be accomplished
      by seeing if prazosin reduces the amount of tau and beta amyloid in the spinal fluid that
      surrounds the brain. If the investigators find such reductions, prazosin will be evaluated as
      a preventative treatment for CTE and AD in future studies.
    ",Prazosin and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarkers in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI),Dementia,Dementia,"
      A majority of neurodegenerative dementing disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, (AD),
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), now appear to be
      caused by the accumulation and aggregation of proteins that cause progressive damage to the
      brain. Recent preclinical results suggest that clearance of such neurotoxic proteins from the
      brain may be greatly increased during states where noradrenergic (NA) tone is decreased or
      blocked, such as anesthesia and normal sleep, but impaired in animal models of mild Traumatic
      Brain Injury (mTBI). These results also suggest that clearance through this mechanism, which
      has been termed the 'glymphatic' system, is likely to be decreased in conditions where NA
      signaling is inappropriately maintained during sleep, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Importantly, the rate at which toxins are cleared through the glypmhatic system has
      been found to be under alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (AR) control, and the application of
      noradrenergic blockers such as the alpha-1 AR antagonist drug, prazosin, has been shown to
      increase waking clearance of these proteins to levels normally found during sleep or
      anesthesia. This suggests two important possibilities: first, that conditions in which the
      brain NA signaling is increased and sleep is impaired, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and mTBI, may predispose people to decreased clearance of neurotoxic proteins
      associated with the development and progression of dementia; and second, that the use of
      prazosin may be able to prevent such effects.

      The hypothesis of the presented study is: Telmisartan induces an increase of eNOS activity in
      RBC resulting in an enhanced intravascular NO bioavailability, an ameliorated RBC
      deformability and a reduction of RBC and platelet aggregation. This could be a potential
      mechanism of the improvement of microcirculatory disorders, especially in patients with
      diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension, treated with Telmisartan.

      Recently, it could be shown that the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) influences different
      signal transduction pathways within the red blood cells (RBC). This includes the Na+/H+
      exchange activity, the Ca2+-ATP-ase mediated Ca2+efflux, the erythropoietin- dependent
      production of RBC, the RBC deformability, RBC aggregation and the interaction of RBC and
      platelets. Recent studies and experiments, done by our group, focus on the oxidative and
      nitrosative metabolism of NO within the blood. The interactions of the RAS and endothelial NO
      are well known and described in detail. Based on a wide experience in this research field of
      NO metabolism, we characterized recently an active endothelial-type NO-synthase in RBC on the
      biochemical, functional and molecular level. Erythrocyte-derived NO formation serves
      important regulatory functions essential for adequate passage of blood through the
      vasculature. Here we aimed to treat patients with diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension
      with Telmisartan as an angiotensin receptor antagonist. Efficacy parameters studied in this
      study should be: i) RBC deformability, RBC aggregation, ii) RBC dependent production of
      nitric oxide as well as detection of eNOS activity in RBC and iii) indices of
      microcirculatory perfusion. This project could broaden the view of effects of Telmisartan in
      the treatment of microcirculatory disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus and arterial
      hypertension, who exhibit a reduced NO bioavailability and RBC function.

      Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is considered a ""surgical disease"" with no medical therapy
      available to improve any clinical outcomes, including symptoms, time to surgery, or long-term
      survival. Thus far, randomized studies involving statins have not been promising with respect
      to slowing progressive valve stenosis. Beyond the valve, two common consequences of aortic
      stenosis are hypertrophic remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary venous
      hypertension; each of these has been associated with worse heart failure symptoms, increased
      operative mortality, and worse long-term outcomes. Whether altering LV structural
      abnormalities, improving LV function, and/or reducing pulmonary artery pressures with medical
      therapy would improve clinical outcomes in patients with AS has not been tested. Animal
      models of pressure overload have demonstrated that PDE5 inhibition influences NO-cGMP
      signaling in the LV and favorably impacts LV structure and function, but this has not been
      tested in humans with AS. Studies in humans with left-sided heart failure and pulmonary
      venous hypertension have shown that PDE5 inhibition improves functional capacity and quality
      of life, but patients with AS were not included in those studies. The investigators
      hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition with tadalafil will upregulate NO-cGMP signaling, reduce
      oxidative stress, and have a favorable impact on LV structure and function as well as
      pulmonary artery pressures and quality of life. In this pilot study, the investigators
      anticipate that short-term administration of tadalafil to patients with AS will be safe and
      well-tolerated.

      hours of analgesia.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the isoniazid is effective in the prevention of
      tuberculosis in a prison population, exposed to the high endemicity of the disease.
    ",Prevention of Tuberculosis in Prisons,"['Tuberculosis, Pulmonary', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis']","['Tuberculosis', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary']","
      Despite being a known disease of mankind over 9000 years, tuberculosis (TB) is still a major
      public health problem in developing countries, mainly due to so-called highly endemic sites,
      such as prisons.

      It is Infectious disease, with airborne transmission, TB can present both the active or
      latent form. Despite the biological aspect of transmission, unhealthy environmental
      conditions (room without direct sunlight, poor ventilation and overcrowded) and individual
      factors (malnutrition, immunosuppression, use of alcohol and other drugs) have significant
      influence on transferability and infectivity.

      With the discovery of drugs active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it was observed a
      reduction of disease incidence in the world. Despite this declining incidence, World Health
      Organization (WHO) classifies TB as a public health problem due to the emergence of multidrug
      strains or extensively resistant to treatment, added to the cases of latent TB reactivation,
      observed with the advent of HIV/AIDS.

      Studies show a direct relationship between the incidence of TB and the prison environment.
      Nevertheless, the presence of prisons in one location increases the incidence of this
      disease, indicating that there is an exchange of disease between the prison and the
      community.

      Currently, control of TB in the prison system is based on the tracking of individuals with
      active TB and / or latent and, in their respective treatment. For the identification of
      individuals with active disease, it is necessary the recognition of respiratory symptoms
      (cough mainly) and sputum smear microscopy and sputum culture, and chest X-ray. As the search
      of individuals with latent form, must be carried to the skin test with Purified Protein
      Derived (PPD).

      Most of the units of the Brazilian's prison system these diagnostic methods are not available
      and hence the transport of individuals for their realization is necessary, generating an
      additional cost, in most cases, unfeasible process execution.

      With the completion of this study, it seek to determine the effectiveness of primary
      prophylaxis in the prison population in order to gather new scientific evidence, to bring
      affordable methods for the control of TB in prisons.

      Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment TB, this is the third leading cause of death from
      infectious diseases worldwide (Naghavi et al, 2015). In 2015, the WHO estimated incidence of
      9.6 million new cases of TB in the world, with about 1.1 million deaths. For Brazil it was
      estimated incidence of 44 cases per 100,000 (WHO, 2015). The incidence of TB has declined
      about 2% per year, but this rate is not homogeneous in the global context.

      Brazil occupies the 22nd place in the ranking of the WHO with an estimated annual rate of
      83,310 cases of the disease (Zumla et al, 2015). In the past seven years, it is estimated
      that the incidence declined only 0.7% (per year). A key factor in this slow progress in TB
      control in Brazil, and other emerging countries is the existence of high-risk subpopulations,
      including slums and prisons, which act as reservoirs and amplifiers for the transmission of
      the disease (Basu; Stückler; Mckee 2011; Dowdy et al, 2012). A recent systematic review
      showed that the average incidence of TB in the prison population can be up to 23 times that
      recorded in the general population (Baussano et al, 2010).

      With the fourth largest prison populations in the world, is observed in Brazil, the increased
      incidence of TB among prisoners in the last seven years. Although prisoners represent only
      0.3% of the population, the increase in the prison population over this period resulted in
      almost doubling the proportion of all TB cases that occur among prisoners (4.1% in 2007, 8,
      1% in 2013).

      The arrests are in an ideal environment for the spread of TB, since they show individuals
      users of tobacco and alcohol in high doses, in addition to drug abuse in overcrowded cells
      with poor ventilation and with limited access to care health and diagnosis of TB. Currently,
      the Ministry of Health recommends active search for TB at the entrance to the prison and once
      a year by chest X-ray. Due to the cost and logistics, most prisons do not adhere to this
      recommendation. There is also a clear recommendation not to use the tuberculin skin test or
      perform the treatment for latent tuberculosis. If the procedures for active case detection
      and / or prophylactic treatment would impact the high transmission in prisons is a question
      that still remains open (Al-Darraji; Kamarulzamn; Altice, 2012).

      The concentration of cases of TB in prisons can represent both an obstacle and an opportunity
      to control the disease, depending on the effectiveness of interventions in these
      environments.

      Preliminary studies show high annual rate of TB infection (26%) among the prison population
      of 12 penitentiaries of Mato Grosso do Sul. Besides the large burden of disease in this
      population is significant dispersion of the TB prison to the community (Sacchi et al, 2015).
      Cross-sectional studies show high yield annual screening for TB, however, the effectiveness
      of this measure combined with other interventions remains unclear (Ferreira et al, 1996;
      Fournet et al, 2006; Lemos et al, 2014; Vieira et al, 2010; Sanches et al, 2013; Walnut;
      Abrahão; Galesi, 2012; Kuhleis et al, 2012; Estevan; Oliveira; Croda, 2013). Due to the
      combination of high force of infection in prisons and short prison term, primary prophylaxis
      may be an effective intervention. This new approach has never been evaluated in the context
      of prisons in low and middle income countries; to assess the impact of program strategies for
      TB screening and prophylaxis, longitudinal data will be essential. Given the infrastructure
      that was created for long-term prospective studies in Brazil, there is an excellent
      opportunity to close the critical knowledge gaps that have been barriers to effective
      implementation of TB control in high transmission prisons.

      and hypotension) were felt to be limiting to recovery. The investigators now use 4-7.5 mg in
      most patients, with 7.5 mg being the exception and have achieved better results. For hip

      epithelial cells exposes the underlying connective tissue with its associated innervations
      causing pain. Oral infections, which may be due to bacterial, fungal, or viruses may further
      exacerbate the mucositis as well as lead to systemic infections.

      Treatment and prevention of therapy related mucositis is essential; unfortunately, the
      efficacy and safety of most of the regimen used have not been clearly established.
      Prophylactic measures employed are use of: chlorhexidine, saline rinses, soda bicarbonate
      rinses, acyclovir, and ice. For treatment of mucositis and its associated pain local
      anesthetic, diphenhydramine, nystatin, or sucralfate are used alone or in combination as
      mouthwash. Oral or parenteral narcotics are also used for pain relief.

      There is a clear need for new therapeutic options for oral mucositis.

      Atrial fibrillation requires both an initiation trigger and favorable environment for
      maintenance and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems play important roles in
      this regard. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms of post operative atrial fibrillation
      (POAF) are still being investigated. This postoperative complication has persisted in spite
      of efforts to mitigate it pharmacologically with beta blockers and amiodarone, an experience
      shared by most other cardiac surgery centers.

      The stellate ganglion is formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion
      and first thoracic sympathetic ganglion. By modulating the sympathetic component of the
      autonomic nervous system, stellate ganglion stimulation has been shown to facilitate
      induction of atrial fibrillation while ablation may reduce or prevent episodes. Human studies
      have further supported this model.

      Preliminary studies of perioperative stellate ganglion block (SGB) in cardiac surgery suggest
      that this technique may reduce or prevent episodes of POAF requiring treatment. The
      investigator's hypothesis is that SGB reduces the incidence of POAF in cardiac surgery
      populations.
    ",Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of SGB in Preventing Post-op Atrial Fibrillation,Atrial Fibrillation,Atrial Fibrillation,"
      The investigator's hypothesis is that perioperative SGB in cardiac surgery will decrease
      POAF. To address this, the investigator will:

        1. Recruit 707 patients to undergo perioperative SGB prior to cardiac surgery (CABG, Aortic
           Valve Replacement, CABG/Aortic Valve Replacement).

        2. Perform a double blinded post-induction/pre-operative SGB using either 10 mL 0.5%
           bupivacaine or 10 mL 0.9% normal saline

        3. Assess the effects on POAF as defined by the Northern New England (NNE) Cardiovascular
           Disease Study Group.

      Significance: If the investigator is able to demonstrate that perioperative SGB in cardiac
      surgery affects POAF, this simple, low cost and low risk procedure may significantly impact
      POAF incidence and thereby its attendant morbidity, mortality and costs in this clinical
      population.

      Study subjects 707 patients electively scheduled for aortic valve, coronary revascularization
      surgery (CABG) or a combination of the two (CABG/AVR) will be recruited and enrolled to
      receive SGB at the time of surgery. Patients will be introduced to the study by their
      surgical team and only those providing informed consent to participate will be enrolled. The
      informed consent document (attached) clearly states that SGB is not currently standard of
      care.

      Randomization The investigator will use NQuery software (Statistical Solutions Ltd., Boston,
      MA) to create a randomization scheme stratified by the three types of elective surgery: CABG,
      aortic valve replacement, and CABG plus aortic valve replacement. Patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SGB (case, injection of 10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine injection) or
      sham SGB (control, injection of 10 mL 0.9% saline). For each of the three surgery types,
      treatment assignments will be placed in opaque envelopes, numbered sequentially; these three
      series of assignments will be maintained in separate surgery-specific boxes. Medications will
      be unidentified at the time of injection and the anesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons will
      be blinded to sham versus treatment group.

      Power analysis:

      Sample size was calculated based on a group sequential test of two proportions (NQuery,
      Statistical Solutions Ltd., Boston, MA), which takes into account a single interim analysis
      of SGB efficacy once 50% of the proposed study group have been enrolled. At 80% power,
      cumulative alpha = 0.05, with a two-sided test with continuity correction, and using the
      O'Brien-Fleming spending function, a total study group of n=632 (n=316/ treatment group)
      would be required to detect a decrease in the rate post-operative atrial fibrillation from
      30% to 20% with stellate ganglion block. After taking the interim analysis (performed when
      n=350; significance accepted at p<0.003) into account, significance will be accepted at
      p<0.047 for the overall study. In our preliminary feasibility study, the investigator
      established that stellate ganglion block was successful in 88% of cases; thus, the sample
      size was increased by 12%, from n=632 to n=707.

      Data analysis. Descriptive statistics (mean (SD), median, frequency as appropriate) will be
      used to summarize the demographic, procedural and clinical characteristics of the study
      group. To evaluate the success of randomization, the investigator will describe demographic
      and clinical data both overall and after stratification by surgery type and by treatment
      type. As intra-operative conditions can direct modification in the actual surgery performed
      (e.g. CABG may become CABG plus valve replacement), the investigator will also describe the
      proportion of subjects who were misclassified by surgery type during randomization and if
      necessary will assess randomization balance according to the actual surgery type received.

      The frequency of atrial fibrillation (AF) will be compared between treatment groups by chi
      square test; this primary analysis will be performed first using an intention to treat model.
      In post hoc analysis the investigator will explore treatment outcomes after stratification by
      type of surgery and established clinical risk factors for POAF (age, sex, smoking, obesity,
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and BMI). If descriptive analyses
      suggest imbalance in clinical or demographic characteristics between treatment groups, these
      will be explored using t tests or their non-parametric equivalent (continuous data) or chi
      square test (categorical data), as appropriate, and logistic regression will be used to
      evaluate differences in AF rate between treatment groups, while taking identified covariates
      into account.

      Postoperative analgesia following spine surgery is difficult to manage. Current treatment
      modalities rely heavily on opioid analgesics with all of the inherent limitations and side
      effects. While current best practice focuses on a 'multimodal approach' (i.e. using multiple
      different drugs and techniques to control pain after surgery), there is no consensus
      regarding which components of this multimodal therapy provide optimal analgesia. This
      prospective randomized study will enroll patients undergoing elective Lumbar Spinal Fusion
      Surgery at Zale Lipshy University Hospital. The primary objective is to determine the
      comparative efficacy of epidural analgesia, as compared with intravenous (IV)
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), on post-operative analgesia.

      Study Design: Prospective study of 58 subjects undergoing elective Lumbar Spinal Fusion (1-3
      levels- posterior approach) at UTSW Zale Lipshy University Hospital with:

        1. Continuous Lumbar Epidural Analgesia (Patient-Controlled Epidural Analgesia- PCEA
           groups)

        2. Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia (IV PCA)

      Study Interventions - The intervention to be evaluated in this study is epidural analgesia
      using an infusion of 0.0625% bupivacaine plus fentanyl 2mcg/ml. The epidural infusion will be
      continued until it is appropriate to transition the patient to a regimen of oral pain
      medications. Duration of epidural catheter will be 72 hours a postoperatively.

      For subjects in the IV PCA group, the intervention will include post-operative IV PCA with
      Hydromorphone.

      Epidural catheters will be placed by the spine surgeon under direct visualization
      intra-operatively prior to closing the surgical incision. Intra-operative epidural catheter
      placement by the spine surgeon will typically be done at the upper end of the dural
      exposure/laminectomy.

      Epidurals will be assessed for efficacy/function in the recovery room post-operatively by the
      APS, and then daily on the floor post-operatively (unless contacted by the floor nurse
      regarding specific concerns).

      Visual analog pain scale (VAS) will be used to evaluate degree of pain at 3, 24, 48, and 72
      hours after surgery.

      Additionally, both the IV PCA and the epidural PCEA groups may be given additional ""rescue""
      pain medications as needed in the recovery room, and these may be continued through the
      post-operative period on the floor.

      Total study duration is approximately 50 days, which starts from operating room admission for
      spinal fusion surgery to the first follow-up visit after discharge.

      Many patients with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with
      strong opioids, of which oxycodone and morphine are examples, they are widely applied in
      clinical treatment because of sustained-released formulation can reduce dosing frequency.
      Goal of pain management is get adequate analgesia and minimize the adverse event at the same
      time, but in fact there are about 10%-30% patients can't get adequate analgesia because of
      intolerable adverse event. The common adverse event of Controlled-Release Oxycodone(CR
      Oxycodone ) are nausea (29.9%)、constipation （25.4%）、dizziness（22.4%） and vomit（11.9%），about
      32.8% patients treatment was discontinued because of these adverse event. The peak
      concentration of opioid is related to adverse event, while the valley concentration is
      correlated to the analgesic effect. Therefore, if we keep the daily dose while increase the
      dose frequency so that reduce the single dose, it's will help to avoid intolerable adverse
      event caused by excessive opioid peak concentration and keep the opioid analgesia at the same
      time. It's a reasonable way to solve the side effects of opioid.

      In order to explore the effect of change the dosing frequency of CR Oxycodone to treat
      refractory pain, pre-experiment have done by several clinical centrals in Fujian province.
      Preliminary results show that for the patients who can't accept the current opioid dose

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to determine if the use of sugammadex (compared with neostigmine)
      reduces the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Secondary objectives are to
      determine if the use of sugammadex compared with traditional reversal agents improves patient
      quality of recovery, reduces the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting and reduces the
      rate of airway complications in the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU).

      Study procedures:

      Following informed consent prior to surgery, patients will be randomised to two groups
      allocating drugs used for reversal of muscle relaxation;

        1. 2mg/kg sugammadex

        2. 50mcg/kg neostigmine with 10mcg/kg glycopyrrolate

      Randomisation will be via computer generated numbers, which will be sealed in opaque,
      sequentially numbered envelopes.

      Treating anaesthetist and staff assessing outcomes will be blinded to treatment.

      Patients will have neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring intraoperatively to ensure
      return of train-of-four count (TOFC) >2 prior to reversal. Muscle relaxant will be limited to
      rocuronium or vecuronium, at the choice of the individual anaesthetist. As this study is
      planned to be a 'real world' trial, mode of anaesthesia, analgesia, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis and time of reversal will be determined by the individual
      treating anaesthetist.

      Postoperative outcome data will be collected in the recovery unit, on postoperative day 1 and
      2 (if still an inpatient), at hospital discharge and via a 30 day post-operative phone call.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Conservatively estimating the baseline incidence of PPC at 7% baseline incidence and an
      equally conservative estimate that sugammadex can reduce this to 3% would produce a
      clinically relevant number needed to treat (NNT) of 29. Accepting an alpha error of 0.05 and
      beta error of 0.2 would require 930 patients. Allowing for 5% incomplete data and loss to
      follow up requires 976 patients.

      Groups will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis

        1. PPC rate, QoR-15 score and hospital stay will be assessed as continuous variables

        2. Post operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) score will be assessed as an ordinal variable

        3. Mortality and the presence of respiratory and PACU events will be assessed as
           categorical variables.

      The effect of sugammadex on continuous variables will be analysed by 2-tailed Student T-test.
      The effect of sugammadex on ordinal and categorical variables will be analysed by Chi-squared
      tests. Binomial regression analysis will be performed on the categorical outcomes for the
      subgroup analyses. Logistic regression will be performed to analyse the effect of PONV risk
      on PONV scores.

      Appropriate statistical tests to confirm test assumptions are met will be performed. In the
      case of non-parametric data, the appropriate test will be performed. Interim analysis is
      planned after 50% data completion.

    ",BOOST: Study of Increased Dosage of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r),HIV Infections,HIV Infections,"
      There are several reasons for low level viremia in patients on Kaletra (LPV/r), including
      poor adherence, incomplete absorption, cellular drug pumps or resistance mutations.
      Increasing exposure to protease inhibitors via boosting with ritonavir increases minimum
      blood concentrations, and is a strategy which has been shown to improve suppression of
      virologic replication. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability and
      safety of increased doses of LPV/r. The objectives of this 24-week single arm pilot study are
      to assess the PK parameters, safety, tolerability, change in viral load and CD4 counts on
      increased dose (600/150 and 800/200 mg) LPV/r in participants with low level viremia on
      standard dose LPV/r-based ART. Participants will undergo six PK samplings over 12 hours on
      standard dose LPV/r. The dose will be increased to 3 tabs (600/150) BID and blood will be
      sampled for PK after two weeks. If tolerated at 8 weeks, the dose will be increased to 4 tabs
      (800/200 mg) BID and final PK sampling will be performed after two weeks. There will be a one

      standard) for soft tissue dissection and removal from vertebral surfaces. This group will be
      the Electrocautery Dissection (ED) group.

      Phase II The same outcomes variables measured on the ED group during Phase I will be
      subsequently collected from a group of patients with adolescent scoliosis, meeting the study
      inclusion criteria and scheduled to undergo PSF surgery. For this study group, surgery will
      be performed with the Harmonic OSTEOVUE™ Spine Soft Tissue Dissector (referred to as the
      OSTEOVUE™ Dissector in this protocol) and metal Cobb elevator, as the primary means of soft
      tissue dissection and removal from vertebral surfaces. This group will be the Ultrasonic
      Dissection (UD) group.

      Patients in the UD group will be recruited from the existing patient population of PSF
      candidates at each participating site.

      Sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients in the
      United States. As evidenced by its increasing prevalence and high mortality rates, sepsis is
      a complex and difficult syndrome to treat. Current therapeutic management of sepsis includes
      fluid resuscitation, vasopressor and inotropic support, maintenance of oxygen delivery,
      drotrecogin alpha, and steroid replacement therapy in patients who are found to have adrenal

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether entecavir treatment increases the

      inhibitors (NRTI), lamivudine, and/or no NRTI treatment, in patients with cirrhosis or
      hepatic failure whose Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores are over 18.
    ",Lactic Acidosis During Entecavir(ETV)Treatment,Lactic Acidosis,"['Acidosis', 'Acidosis, Lactic']","
      Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major cause of hepatic failure worldwide.
      Although the clinical course of HBV infection varies widely, the prognosis of decompensated
      liver cirrhosis is quite poor and the 5-year survival rate has been estimated to be only
      14-35% without treatment. While the ultimate treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is
      orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), several studies have suggested that anti-viral
      therapy can also improve the clinical outcomes in this group of patients.

      Entecavir (ETV) is a potent cyclopentyl guanosine nucleoside inhibitor of the HBV polymerase.
      It has a higher anti-viral potency and a lower resistance rate compared to lamivudine (LAM),
      telbivudine or adefovir, when used for nucleoside/nucleotide-naïve patients. ETV has been
      shown to be effective in patients with both hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive and
      HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, and compensated liver disease. As for patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis, the investigators recently reported that ETV can not only induce
      virological response but also improve underlying hepatic function, and thereby can reduce the
      need for OLT. The cumulative OLT-free survival at 1 year and 2 years was 87.1% and 83%,
      respectively with ETV treatment.

      Despite this dramatic benefit from ETV treatment, a recent study reported that ETV may induce
      lactic acidosis in patients with severe hepatic and/or renal function impairment. Lange et
      al. reported that 5 of 16 patients with severely impaired liver function developed lactic
      acidosis during ETV treatment. Of note, all the five patients who developed lactic acidosis
      had MELD scores over 20, and no increased serum lactate concentrations were observed in other
      11 patients whose MELD scores were below 18. The Child-Pugh score correlated insufficiently
      with a risk of lactic acidosis. This result is not contradictory to our previous study, since
      the investigators did not analyze the incidence of lactic acidosis and the MELD score of the
      studied patients was relatively low (mean value: 11.5)in our study.

      Lactic acidosis has been reported occasionally in association with nucleoside/nucleotide
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs can induce lactic acidosis via interactions
      with the mitochondrial DNA polymerase. Until now, most reported cases were human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects treated with several nucleoside inhibitors of
      the HIV reverse transcriptase. Risk factors include didanosine, stavudine, a combination of
      the two, female gender, age over 40 years, lower CD4 counts, and shorter duration of therapy
      (less than 12 months). As for non-HIV-infected cases, there was only one case report of fatal
      lactic acidosis during combination therapy with adefovir and entecavir prior to the report of
      Lange et al. Interestingly, in vitro inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase was shown for
      lamivudine, adefovir and tenofovir, but not for entecavir.

      Lactate levels in the blood result from the balance between production and clearance. In
      normal physiologic conditions, lactate is produced primarily from skeletal muscle, skin,
      brain, intestine and red blood cells. In severe illness, it can be produced in many other
      tissues including lung, leukocytes, liver, or intestine. Lactate clearance occurs principally
      in the liver (60%), kidney (30%), heart and skeletal muscles. For these reasons, though
      lactic acidosis is typically present in shock states in which oxygen delivery is insufficient
      to meet cellular demand, elevated blood levels can also result from chronic liver disease and
      renal impairment. In addition, many other conditions have been reported in association with
      lactic acidosis even without ongoing evidence of hypoxia or ischemia. Examples are
      malignancy-related metabolic shifts, systemic inflammatory response, hepatic failure, and
      various drugs including acetaminophen, NRTIs, metformin, propofol, thiamine deficiency, total
      parenteral nutrition, and even lactulose. Therefore, in critically ill patients with
      cirrhosis or hepatic failure, lactic acidosis can result from various causes or in
      combination, in addition to the NRTIs. First of all, liver failure per se is associated with
      decreased lactate clearance, which is further aggravated in sepsis or renal failure. The
      liver can also be a source of lactate production and many medications other than NRTIs can
      precipitate lactic acidosis. For these reasons, it is not still conclusive whether ETV
      treatment itself is a direct cause of lactic acidosis in critically ill patients with
      cirrhosis or hepatic failure, since there was no control group in the study of Lange et al. A
      similar scenario was observed in a study performed in HIV-infected patients, in which
      mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio was compared among non-HIV-infected controls, HIV-infected
      individuals not on NRTIs, and HIV-infected individuals on NRTIs. In this study, HIV alone
      affected the mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA ratio, and therefore resulted in lactic acidosis.

      Recently, Wong et al. reported the safety and efficacy of ETV in patients with severe acute
      exacerbation compared to LAM. In this study, ETV treatment was associated with increased
      short-term mortality in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B but
      achieved better virological response in the long run. Wong et al. assumed that the cause of
      increased short-term mortality in ETV-treated patients is due to not only the strong immune
      response but also lactic acidosis. As such, they suggested that LAM may be initiated first
      and routine switching to ETV after liver function has improved or the adoption of the roadmap
      concept are reasonable treatment strategies. However, drug resistance can be a problem in the
      long term because of the increase of resistance mutation for lamivudine or entecavir later in
      patients who have the history of exposure to lamivudine before entecavir treatment in the
      past or have been treated with lamivudine.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate whether ETV treatment increases the incidence
      of lactic acidosis compared to another NRTI, lamivudine, and/or no NRTI treatment, in
      patients with cirrhosis or hepatic failure whose MELD scores are over 18.

      Many heart failure patients are unable to reach target beta blocker doses. This study will
      address whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) will enable uptitration of
      beta-blockers to target doses and whether it will favorably affect remodeling by reducing
      left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV), with measurable clinical benefit, beyond CRT
      alone (without changes in beta-blocker dose).
    ",BOAT: Beta Blocker Uptitration With OptiVol After Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT),Congestive Heart Failure,Heart Failure,"
      Beta blockers have been proven to have benefit in heart failure (HF) patients with regard to
      morbidity and mortality. However, initiation and uptitration remains a challenge in many
      patients. Worsening of heart failure, symptomatic hypotension and symptomatic bradycardia all
      limit up-titration to the target doses that have been shown to have mortality benefits
      (carvedilol [Coreg] 25 mg bid, metoprolol succinate [Toprol-XL] 200 mg qd) in the large
      clinical trials (COPERNICUS, MERIT-HF).

      It is debated whether the benefit of beta-blockade is solely due to heart rate reduction or
      more broadly from the cardiac, central and peripheral effects of blocking sympathetic
      activity. Clearly, there is a remodeling effect on the dilated ventricle. Furthermore,
      patients with heart rates of 64 bpm or less are rarely begun on beta-blocker therapy. It is
      not known whether these patients should be given a pacemaker in order to then safely initiate
      beta-blocker therapy.

      It is also clear that isolated right ventricular pacing can have deleterious effects on
      ventricular dyssynchrony and symptomatic heart failure despite medical therapy. Biventricular
      pacing (BIVPM), also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), is the pacing mode of
      choice for patients with wide QRS complexes and symptomatic HF.

      It is hypothesized that CRT therapy allows for increased Beta -blocker dose (or initiation of
      beta-blocker in patients previously intolerant) with improved NYHA, ejection fraction, and
      remodeling effects. The synergy between two established heart failure therapies requires
      further evaluation in a prospective randomized trial.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether suppressing acid production by
      administration of daily proton pump inhibitors in the early post-operative period will reduce
      the gastrojejunal anastomosis stricture rate in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric
      bypass surgery for morbid obesity.
    ",Study of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) to Prevent Strictures After Gastric Bypass Surgery,"['Anastomotic Stricture', 'Morbid Obesity']","['Obesity', 'Obesity, Morbid', 'Constriction, Pathologic']","
      Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LYRGB) has been shown to be a safe and effective
      procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, a common early complication of LYRGB
      is stricture at the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis, occurring in 4% - 27% of patients,
      usually within the third post-operative month. This complication usually presents with
      progressive dysphagia leading to daily vomiting. Endoscopic balloon dilation is the treatment
      of choice for this complication, and multiple dilations are often required to provide
      complete resolution.

      The etiology of GJ anastomotic strictures is unknown and is probably multi-factorial. Some
      investigators hypothesize that ischemia or non-ischemia-related excessive scar formation is
      the cause of stricture. The method of construction of the anastomosis as well seems to have
      an impact, as circular stapled anastomoses may have higher rates of stricture than linear
      staplers or completely hand-sewn anastomoses. The route of the Roux limb (antecolic vs
      retrocolic) does not appear to affect this complication.

      Several investigators have demonstrated little acid production in the gastric bypass pouch.
      Despite this data, acid secretion has been hypothesized as a predominant factor in the
      development of GJ stricture. This hypothesis is supported in part by the frequent finding of
      ulcers at the site of stricture in up to 55% of patients. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether suppressing acid production by administration of daily proton pump

      antiretroviral regimens that include ritonavir to those in women who take regimens known not

      from 0 to 72 hours, will be increased in women on ritonavir, while ethinyl estradiol levels

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term (4 weeks)
      pharmacological blockade of sympathetic nerve activity (clonidine) on anxiety symptoms,
      vascular function, inflammation, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and oxidant stress in
      individuals with moderate-to-high anxiety. Individuals who are interested in the study will
      be identified by an online screening survey and will be contacted by the research team;
      advertisements, flyers and mass emails will direct individuals to the online screening
      survey. Those deemed eligible to participate will be randomized to either the clonidine
      intervention or hydrochlorothiazide as a blood-pressure lowering control condition. If
      eligible participants are currently being treated with blood pressure-lowering medications,
      they will be asked to go off these medications for 2 weeks prior to and during the course of
      the study. During the 2 week washout of blood pressure-lowering medications, participants
      will have safety visits (2 additional visits) that include measurements of blood pressure at
      4 days and 7 days after the beginning of the washout period before the intervention.
      Assessments of anxiety symptoms via various surveys, vascular function (via non-invasive,
      well-established techniques), inflammation, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and oxidant
      stress will be performed at baseline and at the post intervention session. Similar baseline
      measurements will be performed in control subjects with low or no anxiety for comparison, but
      these individuals will not undergo the intervention.

      which includes the screening and consent (visit 1). Visit 2 (baseline measurements) and visit
      6 (post-intervention measurements) will be more extensive (~4.5 hours) compared to the other
      visits (~30 min). Participants completing the washout will have an additional 2 visits (~30
      min each) before ""visit 2."" Control subjects with low or no anxiety will only participate in
      visit 1 (screening and consent ) and visit 2 (baseline measurements).
    ",Anxiety-mediated Impairments in Large Elastic Artery Function and the Autonomic Nervous System,"['Anxiety', 'Hypertension']",Anxiety Disorders,"
      Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems in the United States, occurring
      in about 18% of adults per year, and a lifetime prevalence of approximately 28% (25).
      Importantly, anxiety disorders are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death
      and non-fatal myocardial infarction (27, 46) independent of other mood disorders (13, 15).
      However, establishing a clear consensus on the mechanism(s) by which chronic anxiety confers
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has proven difficult. Previous studies examining the
      potential role of vascular dysfunction in subjects with anxiety have been confounded by
      co-morbidities (e.g., hypertension, smoking, obesity) (31, 38) and added psychiatric
      disorders (63). Additionally, studies focusing on the relation between anxiety and robust
      predictors of CVD mortality, such as large elastic artery (e.g., aortic, carotid) stiffness,
      have been lacking.

      Anxiety is experienced as negative feelings of threat, restlessness, tension and
      irritability, and somatic symptoms, such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, and dry mouth
      (57). Patients with clinically diagnosed anxiety disorder demonstrate more than 2-fold
      increase in future CVD events (23). Despite the strong association between anxiety and CVD
      risk, there is currently a gap in knowledge describing potential mechanisms by which anxiety
      leads to CVD. Evidence suggests that chronically high levels of anxiety may be associated
      with the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis such as carotid artery intima-media
      thickness (38) and elevated inflammation (5, 44). Symptoms of anxiety may also lead to
      impairment in resistance vessel dilator function (53). However, few studies have examined
      large elastic artery stiffness in subjects with high levels of anxiety. This is clinically
      important because large elastic artery stiffness (i.e., carotid and aortic) is a robust
      independent risk factor for CVD events such as stroke and myocardial infarction (6, 19, 59,
      61). Interestingly, greater large elastic artery stiffness (aortic) is observed with higher
      resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in healthy individuals even after adjusting
      for BP (9, 55). In this regard, numerous studies have shown that high MSNA independent of any
      increase in blood pressure can have deleterious vascular (7, 17, 32), metabolic (2, 20),
      cardiac (50, 52), and renal effects (1, 14, 54). Higher tonic MSNA is an independent
      determinant of aortic artery stiffness as assessed by the gold standard carotid-femoral pulse
      wave velocity (PWV) in healthy humans (55). Even acute increases in MSNA, such as during
      mental stress which is a potent stimulus for increases in MSNA (3), can lead to transiently
      greater large elastic artery stiffness (40). Furthermore, in healthy humans, acute mental
      stress induces transient endothelial dysfunction (16), an important modulator of arterial
      stiffness. Given findings from previous studies (22) showing that anxiety symptoms are
      associated with indices of elevated sympathetic nerve activity (e.g., elevated circulating
      norepinephrine), lead us to our overall hypothesis that anxiety-induced sympathetic
      overactivity leads to increased large elastic artery (carotid and aortic) stiffness in
      subjects with chronic anxiety.

      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine the extent to which measures of vascular and
      autonomic function (large elastic artery stiffness, vascular inflammation and baroreflex
      function) is impaired in subjects with moderate-to-high anxiety, and 2) test the magnitude by
      which short-term (4 weeks) sympathetic nerve activity blockade (clonidine) improves large
      elastic artery stiffness, vascular inflammation and baroreflex function in subjects with
      moderate-to-high levels of anxiety.

      In healthy subjects, chronic anxiety has been associated with increased risk of cardiac
      events (13, 15, 23). Interestingly, evidence suggests baroreflex function is reduced in
      subjects with anxiety (48, 60), thus adding additional cardiac risk burden to this
      population. Consistent with this, impairment in cardiac baroreflex sensivity (BRS) is a
      significant predictor of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction mortality (29, 56).
      Moreover, reduced cardiac BRS is a sensitive predictor of mortality after myocardial
      infarction (28, 30), particularly in subjects with anxiety (47). Reduced baroreflex
      activation can be attributed, in part, to reduced distensibility of baroreceptor regions
      within the elastic carotid and aortic arteries as a result of increased arterial stiffness
      (8). Given the associated risk of cardiac BRS impairment with anxiety, and the increase in
      large elastic artery stiffness in this population, there is a critical need to examine
      whether reductions in SNA and large elastic artery stiffness ameliorates cardiac BRS
      impairment in subjects with anxiety, thus providing experimental support for the novel idea
      that anxiety leads to increased CVD risk at least in part through elevated large artery
      stiffness.

      Empagliflozin, an inhibitor of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), reduces
      post-prandial glucose levels in adults with both type 2 and type 1 diabetes and importantly
      reduces both cardiovascular and renal complications in type 2 diabetes. In adults with type 1
      diabetes empagliflozin improves endothelial function and vascular stiffness when used in
      conjunction with insulin. There is clear evidence that complications in type 1 diabetes have
      their origins during adolescents thus to reduce diabetic complications with adjunctive
      therapy, this age group must be studied. These studies will need to focus on the effects of
      these adjunctive agents on functional biomarkers for development of complications. This study
      is designed to develop pilot and feasibility data for a large scale trial of low dose
      empagliflozin, 2.5 mg daily, on biomarkers for the development of cardiovascular and renal
      complications in adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. The investigators will
      specifically study the effects of 8 weeks of empagliflozin on:

        1. Pre-and post-prandial inflammatory markers using high carbohydrate and high fat meals.
           Inflammatory markers to be measured include interleukin-6 (IL-6), tissue necrosing
           factor α (TNF-α), complement component C3 concentrations and skin advanced glycosylation
           endproducts (AGE).

        2. Pre-and post-prandial vascular function including forearm vascular resistance,
           endothelial function and pulse wave velocity.

        3. Microalbuminuria and pre- and post-prandial glomerular hyperfiltration, tubular injury
           and renal inflammation.

      The investigators will, also, measure more traditional risk markers including blood pressure,
      hemoglobin A1c, and lipids. Eligible participants will have had diabetes for at least 1 year
      and not have other chronic medical illnesses or diabetes complications. Because of the risk
      of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) subjects must have a hemoglobin A1c level less than 9% and
      have no history of recurrent DKA or known insulin omission. This will be the first pilot
      study designed to explore primary endpoints regarding cardiovascular and renal disease rather

      Peri-operative hyperglycemia has been linked to numerous negative adverse consequences,
      including wound infection, impaired wound healing, endothelial dysfunction, neurocognitive
      dysfunction, sepsis, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. This has been shown in
      numerous studies as outlined in our detailed research proposal. The peri-operative period
      includes a timeframe ranging from 12 to 72 hours around the time of surgery according to
      definition. Our study is examining glycemic control in the peri-operative period which we are
      defining as approximately 48 hours around the time of surgery. The majority of the patients
      with type II diabetes take oral medications, such as metformin, to control their blood sugar.
      These patients have historically held their doses on the day of the surgery to avoid possible
      low blood sugar and lactic acidosis while fasting. However, numerous recent studies have
      shown that individuals who are fasting without renal, heart and liver failure are safe to
      take metformin. The most recent guidelines from the American diabetes association suggest
      that patients should take their dose of metformin on the day of surgery. Despite these
      recommendations most anesthesiologists continue to withhold metformin on the day of surgery,
      as no studies exist to show the benefit of continuing metformin. If we are able to show that
      patients taken metformin have better glycemic control during this time we can extrapolate
      that result mean they may have a lower incidence of the consequences linked to poor glycemic
      control.

      Incomplete recovery from ischemia causes stunned myocardium. Ischemia may be due to coronary
      artery disease or aortic cross-clamping during surgery. Stunning leads to myocardial
      dysfunction. It has been suggested that the mechanism responsible for the contractile
      depression in stunned myocardium is a decreased sensitivity of the myofibrils to calcium.
      Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer, which has been shown to improve the function of stunned
      myocardium without obvious impairment of diastolic function. Systemic vasodilation and need
      of vasoconstrictive medication is usually apparent after administration of levosimendan.
      Colucci et al have demonstrated that with intracoronary administration of milrinone, another
      inodilator, systemic vasodilation could be excluded. If this is true with levosimendan, it
      may be possible to improve left ventricular hypo/dyskinesia without afterload reduction by
      adding levosimendan into cardioplegia solution.

      The investigators hypotize that levosimendan, delivered together with cardioplegia, can
      improve LV dysfunction after opening of aortic cross-clamp in patients undergoing aortic
      valve and coronary artery bypass operation. Our primary endpoint is a change in cardiac
      output 15 min after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass compared to the baseline.
      Secondary endpoints are a change in LV ejection fraction from baseline to 5 min after sternal

      Given the high prevalence of bone alteration in the course of HIV infection or antiretroviral

      beneficial and being associated with reduced bone mineral density loss measured by DEXA

      As tranexamic acid (TXA) becomes more prevalent, all patients are receiving the same dose
      regardless of their pre-operative risk of transfusion. Therefore the aim of the study is to
      determine whether or not repeated dosing of oral TXA reduces the post-operative reduction in
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of transfusions, and post-operative blood loss following
      primary TKA and THA surgeries in patients with low pre-operative hematocrit and high risk for
      transfusion. The investigators hypothesize that a multi-dose TXA regimen will significantly
      minimize post-operative blood loss and transfusion requirements compared to the use of a
      single dose regime.
    ",Single Versus Multi-Dose Oral Tranexamic Acid in Patients at High Risk for Blood Transfusion After Total Joint Arthroplasty,"['Anemia', 'Arthritis', 'Total Knee Arthroplasty', 'Total Hip Arthroplasty']",Arthritis,"
      Total joint arthroplasty is associated with the risk of moderate to significant blood loss.
      Because TXA has been shown to significantly reduce the need for blood products during total
      joint replacement, it is now the standard of care at many institutions. Oral and intravenous
      TXA are equivalent, but oral TXA is cheaper and allows for ease of repeat dosing. Although
      low preoperative hemoglobin is a risk factor for transfusion, no studies that have compared
      standard TXA dosing to risk stratified dosing of TXA. The investigators hypothesize that a
      multi-dose TXA regimen will significantly minimize post-operative blood loss and transfusion
      requirements compared to the use of a single dose regimen.

      Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling illness for which there is no specific treatment. As
      a group, CFS patients have disturbed sleep with frequent arousals and the sense of not having
      slept upon awakening. Xyrem (Sodium oxybate) is known to improve deep sleep and so may reduce
      the sleep disturbances of CFS leading to better sleep with less fatigue. Its ability to
      produce the rapid onset of deep sleep is a reason it became a street drug, but its
      availability is currently limited via distribution through a single centralized pharmacy.
      Xyrem has been successfully used based on results from a study on patients with fibromyalgia
      (FM), an ailment closely resembling CFS. However, in that study, the researchers provided no
      information as to whether patients had FM alone or FM plus CFS. Thus, it is not clear from
      this study just which patient may be helped. I have prescribed Xyrem for patients who have
      both FM and CFS with good results. In this study, funded by the company that makes Xyrem, I
      propose testing the drug's efficacy on patients with CFS alone - that is, they do not have
      fibromyalgia.

      Volunteers for this study will complete paper and pencil questionnaires about their symptoms
      as well as a computerized test to assess their degree of brain fog. They will then be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups, placebo or drug. Volunteers will not know what group
      they are in until the end of the study. Only the drug group will receive the medication. The
      placebo group will receive a substance that looks identical to the real medicine but with no
      active ingredients. The medication comes as a liquid and patients will start taking an
      initial dose about 30 min before they expect to sleep. If subjects awaken after less than 5
      hrs of sleep, they will take a second dose. If they sleep more than 5 hrs, they will be told
      to skip taking the second dose. We will call patients weekly to see how they are doing on the
      ""drug."" If they have tolerable side effects or report significant improvement, we will
      maintain the dose. But if patients report no effect of treatment, the dosage will be
      incremented by 1 ml per week until good sleep is achieved or a predetermined maximum is
      reached.
    ",Use of Xyrem to Improve Sleep in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"['Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic', 'Syndrome', 'Fatigue']","
      Medically unexplained fatigue occurs in about 5% of the population with 10% of that number
      fulfilling formal case definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome1. Medically unexplained
      fatigue is a major problem for both patient and practitioner - for both because there is no
      effective FDA-approved treatment for the symptom. One major problem for these patients is
      unrefreshing sleep. Formal sleep studies show reduced total sleep time and reduced sleep
      efficiency compared to controls.2;3 We are currently in the early stages of an NIH-funded
      grant designed to study cytokines during sleep. Preliminary results support awake time for
      patients relative to controls, producing a decreased sleep efficiency. These data lead to our
      working hypothesis that the problem of severe daytime fatigue is due to a previously
      unappreciated form of sleep pathology related to sleep fragmentation.

      Patients with medically unexplained pain also complain of disturbed sleep. Sodium oxybate has
      been tested on patients with this complaint who fulfill a formal case definition for
      fibromyalgia and has found to reduce symptoms and improve sleep quality.4 Specifically, six
      of 7 pain/fatigue scores (overall pain, pain at rest, pain during movement, end of day
      fatigue, overall fatigue, and morning fatigue) were relieved by 29% to 33% with sodium
      oxybate, compared with 6% to 10% relief with placebo (p < 0.005). Alpha intrusion indicative
      of disturbed sleep, sleep latency, and rapid-eye-movement sleep were significantly decreased,
      while slow-wave (stage 3/4) sleep was significantly increased, compared with placebo (p <
      0.005). Two of the 5 subjective sleep related variables were significantly different from
      placebo: morning alertness (improved by 18% with sodium oxybate, compared with 2% for
      placebo; p = 0.0033) and quality of sleep (improved by 33% and 10%, respectively; p =
      0.0003).

      Importantly, approximately 40% of patients in my study group fulfill case definitions
      simultaneously for CFS and FM. Since we do not know if patients in either sodium oxybate
      treatment trial had CFS, we cannot be sure whether efficacy was specific for FM or instead
      may have occurred due to the fact that a large representation of CFS had occurred.

      An unpublished Phase II randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in FM, done by Jon
      Russell and colleagues in Dallas and presented at the 2005 meeting of the American College of
      Rheumatology, reported substantial symptom improvement with statistically significant
      benefits in self reported pain scales and patient global impression of improvement at both
      doses of sodium oxybate tested compared with placebo [4.5g [9ml] total dose per night;
      p=0.005 and 6g [12 ml], p=0.048]. Improvement in outcome variables was 34.5% at the 4.5g and
      27.3% at the 6g compared to 12.5% in the placebo group.

      I have prescribed sodium oxybate in my own practice for patients who have both CFS and FM
      with good results. Anecdotally, patients reporting less pain also reported better quality
      sleep and less fatigue upon awakening. This has led me to hypothesize that sodium oxybate
      will reduce fatigue in patients with CFS alone (i.e., without also having FM).

      To test this hypothesis, I propose doing a double blind, placebo controlled trial of sodium
      oxybate in 30 patients who fulfill a formal case definition for chronic fatigue syndrome and
      who do not also have FM.

    ",Duration of GnRH-analogue Downregulation and Pregnancy Rates,Infertility,Infertility,"
      GnRH agonists have been used extensively in assisted reproduction technologies for inhibition
      of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation.
      Administration of GnRH agonists results in the prevention of spontaneous LH surges, which
      lead to luteinization of the developing follicles, initiation of final oocyte maturation and
      a decrease in pregnancy rates.

      GnRH agonists are usually administered according to two protocols: the short and long
      protocol.In the long protocol, downregulation with GnRH agonists is initiated either in the
      middle of the secretory phase, or at the beginning of the follicular phase. Stimulation of
      the ovaries with gonadotropins is initiated when downregulation is confirmed.

      Administration of gonadotropins is usually started during the second or third week of
      treatment with GnRH agonists.The possibility of earlier initiation of the ovarian
      stimulation, if downregulation is confirmed at an earlier stage, has not been examined so
      far.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the duration of pituitary downregulation with
      GnRH agonists, prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins, has any effect
      on pregnancy rate, in women undergoing IVF.

      Ureteroscopy is a common procedure in Urology that patients undergo daily to deal with a
      variety of ailments. These procedures often require that the bladder be filled and emptied
      with sterile water or saline several times during the procedure, and often result in the
      patient receiving a catheter at the end of the procedure. One common side effect is that
      patients experience bladder spasm or discomfort for a period of time after these procedures.
      Belladonna and Opium (B and O) suppositories and PO Oxybutynin are often given in the
      post-operative setting to relieve these symptoms.

      The principle objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine if the addition of a B and O supprette suppository at the end of
           cystoscopic/ureteroscopic procedures reduces the incidence of bladder spasms and urinary
           discomfort that patients experience in the post-operative setting.

           for pos-operative oral Ditropan and use of narcotic pain medications.

      position after the procedure. There will be a ""Postoperative OR"" group which will receive a B
      and O suppository while still in the operating room in the lithotomy position after the
      procedure. Finally, there will be a ""Preoperative OR"" group which will receive a B and O
      suppository after the induction of anesthesia prior to beginning the urologic procedure in
      the lithotomy position. The ""Control Group"" will receive a rectal exam in the operating room
      after the procedure but before extubation to simulate the effects of suppository
      administration so that the investigators know that any effects are due to the medication and
      not to the placement of the suppository itself. Those patients in the ""control group"" may
      receive a B and O suppository as part of standard procedure in the post-operative period if
      these individuals experience any bladder spasms and wish to have this as a treatment. This
      administration will be at the discretion of the operating surgeon as it is in standard cases.
      Patients may also receive Ditropan in the post-operative setting, which is part of the
      standard procedure for treating bladder spasms following urologic procedures. Patients in the
      postoperative and preoperative OR groups will be offered Ditropan for any bladder spasms in
      the post-operative setting to control symptoms, which is part of the normal standard of care
      for anyone who has already received a B and O suppository with inadequate control of
      symptoms. All patients will be treated with a normal post-operative pain regimen which may
      include narcotics. This will be at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are at an increased risk of fracture, despite
      having bone mineral density (BMD) levels similar to age and sex matched cohorts. Recent
      studies have indicated that changes in incretin (INtestinal seCRETion of INsulin) hormones in
      the setting of T2DM may play a role in bone metabolism. Two of these incretin hormones,
      gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), have been shown to
      be involved in bone turnover regulation, in addition to their effect in increasing insulin
      secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. In addition, the
      rise in glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) in the postprandial state has been found to have a
      direct effect on reduced bone resorption in a non-fasting state and treatment with GLP-2
      improved BMD in postmenopausal women. Due to their glucose lowering effects, incretin
      hormones have been a therapeutic target for the treatment of T2DM through GLP-1 receptor
      agonists (i.e. exenatide) or inhibition of incretin hormone metabolism via dipeptidyl
      peptidase 4 (DPP-4)inhibitors. The GLP-1 receptor analog exenatide leads to an approximate
      13-fold increased GLP-1 effect compared to approximate doubling of incretin hormone levels
      with current DDP-4 inhibitors. In rodent models, calcitonin levels rise significantly
      following treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists, leading to c-cell hyperplasia. However,
      review of calcitonin changes in humans and cynomolgus monkeys treated with GLP-1 receptor
      agonists have not shown similar results.

      HIV related cognitive impairment still occurs despite highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART). HIV disease affects the brain in 20-40% of patients with advancing HIV disease
      leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment, recently termed HIV associated
      neurocognitive disorders (HAND).

      HAND may occur in patients who are virally suppressed in both blood and CSF. Patients with
      HIV Associated Neurological Disorders (HAND) who are virally suppressed in both their blood
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whilst on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
      regimen may have significant cognitive improvement with HAART intensification with the
      medication Raltegravir; compared to those who remain on their existing regimen.

      This study will be a prospective, interventional, randomised and unblinded controlled
      clinical trial. The aim of this study will be to determine whether HAART intensification with
      the medication Raltegravir, leads to significant improvement in HIV associated neurological
      disorders (HAND).

      Patients with the recent progression (within 6 months) of HAND (validated by
      neuropsychological assessment) on HAART who are virally suppressed (<50 copies per ml) in
      blood and CSF will be randomised to have their existing HAART regimen intensified with
      raltegravir 400mg twice daily, or not. The control arm will remain on their medication
      regimen as prescribed. The target is to enrol 110 patients into the control group, and 110
      patients into the Raltegravir intensification group.

      Patients will undergo baseline neuropsychological testing, MRI, blood tests, and cerebral
      spinal fluid (CSF) tests (via a lumbar puncture). The methods used to determine the
      effectiveness of adding Raltegravir, will include further neuropsychological testing at 6
      months; and neuropsychological testing, MRI and CSF assessment at 12 months.
      Neuropsychological testing completed at 6 and 12 months will be completed by a ""blind
      assessor"", in that they will have no knowledge of which arm (treatment or control) the
      participant is enrolled in.

      during the course of the study, as recognised by the patient's managing physician. The
      decision of the Antiretroviral medication regimen to be used in such a case will be
      determined by the managing physician. At the end of the study protocol (12 months) the

      Warfarin (also called Coumadin®) is an anticoagulant drug (blood thinner) given to patients
      to help prevent blood clots from forming or to help prevent the growth of an existing blood
      clot. The purpose of this study is to collect information on a possible method used to
      determine the best warfarin dose for people before they start warfarin. This study will focus
      on finding out if a person's stable dose can be better predicted by using a new approach
      (called ""pharmacogenetic-guided dosing"") compared to the current warfarin dosing method. The
      pharmacogenetic-guided dosing method (the new warfarin dosing method) will use a person's
      specific health and genetic information to calculate a patient's warfarin dose at the
      beginning of warfarin treatment. The hope is that through this research, we may someday be
      able to use an individual's genetic information to guide the selection of their specific
      warfarin dose at the beginning of treatment, leading to precise warfarin dosing and less need
      for the current trial and error process.
    ",PRospective Evaluation Comparing Initiation of Warfarin StrategiEs (PRECISE): Pharmacogenetic-guided Versus Usual Care,Blood Coagulation Disorders,"['Hemostatic Disorders', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders']","
      Warfarin is the mainstay of therapy in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary
      embolism (PE), and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Despite its proven efficacy in
      reducing the advent of clot formation, patient-specific warfarin dosing is difficult to
      predict, with the initial dose regimen often resulting in supra- and subtherapeutic
      anticoagulation, and subsequently increasing patients' risk of bleeding or embolism. It has
      been shown that interpatient warfarin dosing variability is due in part to genetic variations
      found in the cytochrome P450 2C9 metabolism pathway (CYP2C9), as well as proteins involved in
      the coagulation cascade, most importantly vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1
      (VKORC1). A recent retrospective study has shown that these two genes in addition to several
      clinical/demographic factors account for greater than 58% of the variation in
      patient-specific warfarin doses. However, there have been no studies documenting prospective
      use of this information in selecting an initial warfarin dose. Hypothesis: Stable therapeutic
      management of warfarin therapy can be more precisely achieved when patients are prospectively
      dosed based on a pharmacogenetic-guided dosing equation compared to usual care. Aim a: To
      determine if pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of warfarin is superior to usual care, when
      defined as the accuracy of the initial versus the stable warfarin dose. This will be assessed
      as the mean absolute difference in initial versus stable dose. Aim b: To determine if a
      stable warfarin dose is more quickly achieved using the pharmacogenetic-guided dosing
      equation compared to usual care. This will be assessed as time to stable dose. Aim c: To
      determine if pharmacogenetic-guided dosing is superior to usual care in terms of overdosing
      and underdosing patients. This will be assessed as the fraction of the population overdosed
      and the fraction of population underdosed by the two methods. We propose to evaluate a
      pharmacogenetic-guided dosing approach compared to usual care in the initiation of warfarin
      management. The selected pharmacogenetic-guided equation is a validated equation that
      includes both genetic and clinical factors and is relatively easy to incorporate into current
      clinical practice. Patients newly initiating warfarin therapy in a hospital setting will be
      randomized to receive either pharmacogenetic-guided or usual care, with follow-up
      anticoagulation management services provided by the University of Florida Health System
      Anticoagulation Clinic. Prospectively determining patients' stable dose has important
      clinical implications in today's management of warfarin therapy. Being able to predetermine a
      patient's stable dose upon initiation of therapy has the potential to decrease the time spent
      in supra- and subtherapeutic anticoagulation and reduce the number of clinic visits required
      to achieve a stable dose. Therefore we propose this study to test if using genotype data in
      determining the initial warfarin dose is more effective than usual care in predicting stable
      dose. If we can document the value of such an approach, this will provide the level of
      evidence needed to translate pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of warfarin into clinical
      practice.

      Increased inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of
      neuropsychiatric illnesses including mood disorders, which affect almost 30 million adults in
      the United States alone. One mechanism by which inflammation may alter behavior is through
      increasing brain glutamate, a neurotransmitter that in excess has been implicated in neuronal
      toxicity and resistance to conventional antidepressant therapy. The goal of the proposed
      research is to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters behavior through increasing
      glutamate in specific brain regions, ultimately leading to behavioral changes.

      The proposed research is designed to determine the cause and effect relationship between
      inflammation and CNS glutamate as well as the relationship between CNS glutamate and specific
      symptoms. To accomplish these aims, investigators will administer a single infusion of either
      the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab or placebo (n=30 per group) to patients
      with high inflammation (CRP>3mg/L). A CRP>3mg/L was chosen because it is considered high
      inflammation according to guidelines by the American Heart Association. Moreover, a CRP>3mg/L
      is associated with significantly increased basal ganglia glutamate and with a clinical
      response to infliximab. Inflammatory biomarkers, basal ganglia glutamate as measured by MRS,
      and motivation and psychomotor activity will be assessed at baseline and days 1 and 3 and
      weeks 1 and 2 following infliximab or placebo administration.

      This study aims to test the hypothesis that increased inflammation causes increased basal
      ganglia glutamate and consequently anhedonia and psychomotor retardation in patients with
      major depressive disorder (MDD). Excessive inflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity are two
      pathways that have received increasing attention regarding the pathophysiology of
      neuropsychiatric disease including mood disorders. Patients with depression exhibit increased
      peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) markers of inflammation as well as altered CNS
      glutamate as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In addition, drugs that block
      either inflammation or glutamate signaling can reverse depressive symptoms, especially in
      depressed patients with treatment resistance.

      Inflammatory cytokines are known to inhibit glutamate reuptake and increase glutamate release
      from astrocytes, and glutamate antagonists have been shown to block inflammation-induced
      depressive-like behavior in mice. Moreover, using MRS, data has shown that administration of
      the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-alpha significantly increases glutamate in the
      basal ganglia in association with IFN-alpha-induced anhedonia and psychomotor slowing. In
      addition, increased inflammation as reflected by peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP) is
      correlated with increased basal ganglia glutamate in association with decreased motivation
      and psychomotor speed in patients with MDD. Nevertheless, the data to date has been
      correlational, and whether increased inflammation causes increased glutamate in the basal
      ganglia, which in turn contributes to behavioral changes in patients with depression has not
      been established.

      To test this hypothesis, investigators plan to determine the cause and effect relationship
      between increased inflammation and increased CNS glutamate by blocking inflammation in
      depressed patients with high inflammation (CRP>3mg/L) using the highly specific tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist infliximab (n=30) versus placebo (n=30). In addition, the
      study team will examine whether changes in basal ganglia glutamate are linked to changes in
      behaviors related to the basal ganglia including anhedonia and psychomotor retardation.

      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic relapsing condition with significant psychosocial
      impact and morbidity, but that doesn't mean that patients will necessarily be adherent to
      recommended treatments. Patients, especially those on chronic medication therapy, inevitably
      miss doses. They use too little or too much therapy. They may take medications too soon or
      too far apart. While adherence to injection treatments tend to be better than adherence to
      topical or oral treatment, adherence to injections may still be poor.

      Traditional methods for measuring medical adherence-including questionnaires, surveys, and
      diaries- tend to be unreliable overestimate adherence. Chemical markers are problematic
      because of the tendency for patients to use their medication right before visits, so called
      ""white coat compliance."" Our research team has pioneered the use of electronic monitoring
      devices which measure and record the date and time of medication events to assess adherence
      in dermatology. The study team have demonstrated the feasibility of using such monitors to
      measure adherence to adalimumab in patients with psoriasis. Although only a small study, it
      documented a broad range of how patients use adalimumab and found that adherence was poor in
      about half of the patients. While the impact of psoriasis on patients' lives is large,
      adherence is still poor. How adherent patients with hidradenitis are to weekly adalimumab
      treatment is not yet well characterized.

      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a test that can be performed at the time of heart
      catheterization. It measures the change in pressure across a narrowing in the heart artery
      during high flow situation, and provides reliable information about the functional severity
      of the narrowing. FFR measurements accurately predict whether a stent is needed, and is
      considered an excellent test before placement of stents to treat narrowed heart arteries.

      sponsoring this study to find out if FFR should be used in most cases (routine), rather than
      the current selective approach.
    ",Routine Versus Selective Use of FFR to Guide PCI,"['Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Coronary Atherosclerosis', 'Angina, Unstable']","['Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Angina, Unstable']","
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an effective, less invasive mode of
      revascularization compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In 2011, a total of
      7,614 PCI procedures were performed in British Columbia (BC). While some procedures were done
      emergently for life-threatening indications (e.g. ST elevation myocardial infarction - STEMI
      or cardiogenic shock), most (6,169 cases in year 2011) were done at the discretion of the
      treating physicians, taking patient preference into account. A number of factors are usually
      considered before proceeding with PCI. These may include clinical presentation (stable angina
      versus acute coronary syndrome); severity of symptoms (asymptomatic or highly symptomatic);
      response to medical therapy; severity of ischemia based on non-invasive functional testing
      (mild, moderate, or severe); predicted risk (low, intermediate, or high); and findings on
      coronary angiography (lesion number, location, severity, and morphology, etc). However,
      interpretation of symptoms is subjective. Non-invasive tests for ischemia may not be
      reliable. In addition, coronary angiography uses 2 dimensional images to depict 3-dimensional
      structures, and there is well known limitations.

      The concept of using fractional flow reserve (FFR) to predict the functional significance of
      coronary lesions was described > 20 years ago. In 1996, Pijls et al showed that measurements
      of FFR in the cardiac catheterization laboratory can accurately predict provoked ischemia
      upon non-invasive functional testing. The DEFER study (2007) showed that coronary lesions
      with non-ischemic FFR values can be treated with medical therapy with good clinical outcome
      at 5-year follow up. The FAME-1 study (2009) evaluated the strategy of PCI guided by
      angiography versus PCI guided by FFR measurements in multi-vessel disease. The primary
      end-point was the 1-year composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and any repeat
      revascularization. Fewer stents were used per patient for the FFR-guided group (2.7 versus
      1.9 stents per patient), less contrast agent used (302 versus 272 ml), and lower in-lab
      equipment cost ($6,007 US versus $5,332 US), all significant with P<0.001. A total of 1,005
      patients were randomized. At 1-year follow up, the composite end-point of death, MI and
      target vessel revascularization was 18.2% for the angiography-guided group versus 13.3% for
      the FFR-guided group (p < 0.02). At 2-year follow up, the incidence of death and MI was lower
      for the FFR-guided group (12.7% versus 8.4%, p<0.03), and the incidence of MI in the
      FFR-guided and PCI deferred population was very low at 0.2%.

      Since the publication of the FAME-1 study, the use of pressure wires to measure FFR increased
      from ~400 cases per year to ~1,000 cases per year in BC. However, in comparison with an
      annual non-emergent PCI volume of >6,000 cases per year, the use of FFR appears highly
      selective (1,058 out of 6,169, 17%, based on year 2011 statistics). In a series of 442
      consecutive FFR cases done at the Vancouver General and St. Paul's Hospitals (year 2011 to
      2012), the use of FFR identified non-ischemic lesions in 52%, and this resulted in a change
      in management decision in 68%. In addition, provincial data showed significant variation in
      the use of FFR among the 5 PCI capable hospitals in BC (from <5% to ~30%). Based on the
      recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the use of FFR to guide revascularization
      has a class 1a indication in multi-vessel disease, while the US guidelines (American College
      of Cardiology, ACC) has a class 2a recommendation for the use of FFR in evaluating coronary
      lesions of intermediate severity. It is possible that a highly selective approach to the use
      of FFR may lead to underuse, which in turn may lead to overuse of PCI, with increased cost,
      and adverse clinical outcome.

      We hypothesize that the routine use of FFR may improve clinical outcome, decrease the number
      of PCI, and decrease direct cost in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. We propose a
      randomized study to compare 2 approaches of using FFR to guide PCI: (1) routine use - the
      experimental arm; and (2) selective use - the current standard.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled pilot safety study that
      will enroll a total of twenty subjects. Subjects will be adults (30-75) who have sustained a
      SAH secondary to cerebral aneurysm rupture and who present with minimal neurological
      symptoms. All subjects will have a Hemoglobin less than or equal to 12 g/dL within 24 hours
      prior to study entry and undergo operative aneurismal clipping. Subjects will be randomized
      into two groups, ten subjects receiving the drug and ten subjects receiving the placebo. The
      subjects will receive three intravenous injections of study drug or placebo, once before
      undergoing operative aneurysmal clipping (study Day 1) and again for two additional days
      (study Day 2 and study Day 3).

      There are 3 phases to this trial:

      Screening Phase - patients will present with Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and prepped for
      surgery within 36 hours Treatment Phase - first pre-operative dose before surgery (Study Day
      1), post-operative (Study Days 2 and 3) Follow-up Phase- Study Day 4 through discharge, 6-7
      week follow-up Primary Objective: To determine the safety of administering intravenous doses
      of Procrit® once daily for three consecutive days to patients with aneurysmal SAH before and
      after vascular clipping by comparing the incidence of thrombotic events, hemoglobin and 6-7
      week mortality between the Procrit® and placebo groups. Secondary Objectives: To determine if
      administration of Procrit® prior to aneurysm clipping reduces the incidence of vasospasm
      following a SAH event treated by vascular clipping. To determine if Procrit® administration
      prior to aneurysm clipping in patients with Aneurysmal SAH will improve neurological
      assessment scores in the post-SAH/post-clipping time period. To determine the feasibility of
      organizing a larger, randomized study to explore the neuroprotective effect of Procrit® in
      patients with Aneurysmal SubArachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) when Procrit® is administered prior to
      surgical clipping of the aneurysm.

      It is hypothesized that Procrit will provide a significant level of neuroprotection in the
      brain after an SAH event as a result of reduced cell death, as well as a reduced amount of
      vasospasm activity and delayed cerebral ischemia which can occur as a result of SAH. These
      factors may contribute to improved neurological functioning scores when compared to the
      placebo treated patients.

      Current opinion regarding the use of steroids in the treatment of chronic subdural hematomas
      are mostly based on observational studies. Here we present data from a prospective randomized
      pilot study of twenty chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) patients treated with dexamethasone or
      placebo for 30 days.

      Twenty patients with computed tomography (CT)- or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed
      CSDH were recruited from a single center and randomized in order to receive dexamethasone or
      placebo as a conservative treatment. Patients affected to the treatment group received oral
      dexamethasone 12mg/day for three weeks followed by tapering. These patients were followed for
      6 months and the rate of success of conservative treatment versus placebo was measured.
      Parameters such as hematoma thickness and global impression of change were also compared
      before and after treatment with chi-square tests. Adverse events and complications were
      documented.

      Patients Recruitment for this single-center double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study
      was performed between January 2007 and May 2009. Patients were enrolled based on the
      following inclusion criteria: 18 years and older with evidence of subacute or chronic
      supratentorial subdural hematoma by CT (computerized tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic
      resonance imaging) and classified between 0 and 2 using the Markwalder grading scale (17)
      (Grade 0 for normal neurological status, grade 1 for no neurological deficits but mild
      symptoms, grade 2 for focal or variable neurological deficits, grade 3 for several focal
      neurological signs, and grade 4 for comatose). Exclusion criteria included contraindications
      or intolerance to corticosteroid therapy or patients already undergoing steroid treatment for
      any other indication, previous neurological surgery up to one year prior to being considered
      for the study, concomitant cerebral pathology of neoplastic or presumed infectious origin,
      anticoagulant therapy that could not be stopped for 6 months and refusal to participate in
      the study. If at any time, patients developed a sudden increase in hematoma volume, a midline
      displacement of greater than 1cm or a deterioration of their level of consciousness, they
      were removed from the conservative study protocol in order to undergo surgery.

      This study was approved by the research ethics board at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire
      (CHU) de Quebec. Written and fully informed consent was obtained from each participant.

      Randomization Allocation to each group was done in a 1:1 ratio with block sizes ranging from
      4 to 6, to one of the two arms ; a treatment arm in which participants received dexamethasone
      according to the protocol, and a control group in which they received placebo. Randomization
      was performed via a web-based service by a pharmacist, which was not involved in any other
      part of the study. Both investigators and participants were blind to treatment allocation.

      Treatment Participants allocated to the treatment group received a daily dosage of 12mg (4mg
      three times a day) of dexamethasone for three weeks. Corticosteroid treatment was then
      tapered off over the next week (8mg for 48 hrs, 4mg for 48 hrs, 2mg for 48 hrs and 1mg for 24
      hrs). Identical oral capsules filled with lactose were administered to the control (placebo)
      group for 28 days. Participants were returned at home with blister packs containing their
      medication for each day of the trial and were asked to return empty packs to ensure
      compliance with the assigned treatment. The treatment (placebo or dexamethasone) was
      discontinued if a patient required surgical drainage of its hematoma or suffered from
      significant side effects.

      Evaluation and follow-up The primary outcome of this pilot study was to determine the
      efficacy of dexamethasone as compared with placebo in reducing the rate of surgical
      intervention for CSDH graded 0 to 2 on the Markwalder grading scale (Grade 0 for normal
      neurological status, grade 1 for no neurological deficits but mild symptoms, grade 2 for
      focal or variable neurological deficits, grade 3 for several focal neurological signs, and
      grade 4 for comatose).

      Eligible patients who consented for the study underwent the routine standard of care. This
      included 1) a complete medical history review and neurological physical exam ; 2) head
      computerized tomography (CT) or MRI with measurement of maximal hematoma thickness (in mm),
      midline shift ; 3) and a check of blood and vital parameters. In addition, patients were
      asked to complete detailed questionnaires measuring symptoms typically associated with
      subdural hematomas.

      Follow-up appointments were scheduled 2 weeks, 1, 2 and 6 months after initiation of
      treatment. At each visit, the three components of the clinical evaluation described above
      were repeated. Moreover, a seven point categorical scale was used to evaluate patient's
      global impression of change relative to the initial state (unchanged , very much improved,
      much improved, minimally improved, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse).
      Treatment-related side effects were also inquired about and collected.

      The rate of success of conservative management was defined as the percentage of patients not
      requiring surgery in each treatment group during the 6 months following enrollment.
      Radiological progression of the hematoma in terms of thickness and magnitude of midline
      shift, hematoma-related symptoms and medication-related side effects were carefully
      collected.

      Statistical analyses Demographical characteristics, baseline neurological status and hematoma
      size and location were compared for both groups using a Mann-Whitney test for continuous
      variable and a χ2 test for categorical variables.

      To compare the rate of success, a categorical frequency comparison with the Fisher's exact
      test was used. For the other outcome measures we used Mann-Whitney U test and Student's
      t-test for normally distributed variables and χ2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical
      frequencies. All statistical tests were done with the Statistical package for Social Sciences
      software version 16.0 and the significance threshold was set at p<0.05.

      The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aim to evaluate the effect of 1-month
      therapy with folic acid (5 mg/day) on endothelial function and baroreceptor function in
      patients with heart failure.

      Endothelial function will be studied non-invasively with flow-mediated dilation while for
      eveluating baroreceptor function sympathetic nervous system activity will be measured
      directly with microneurography in baseline condition and during infusion of
      sodium-nitroprusside.
    ",Effect of Folic Acid on Endothelial and Baroreceptor Function in Patients With Heart Failure,Heart Failure,Heart Failure,"
      Endothelial and baroreceptor function are impaired in patients with heart failure.

      Impaired baroreflex control of the heart and peripheral circulation and endothelial
      dysfunction are thought to play an important pathophysiological role in chronic heart failure
      and confers a poor prognosis.

      In patients with essential hypertension we demonstrated an improvement in baroreceptor
      function after treatment with folic acid.

      Therefore, the aim of the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to
      evaluate endothelial function and baroreceptor function in patients with heart failure before
      and after 1-month therapy with folic acid (5 mg) or placebo.

      Endothelial function will be assessed with novel high-resolution ultrasound devices, which
      allows to investigate endothelial function in vivo. This method makes use of the property of
      the endothelium to release nitric oxide in response to shear stress and increased flow as
      previously described. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and
      endothelium-independent glycerol trinitrate (GTN) (0.4 mg sublingual, Nitrolingual Spray,
      Pohl-Boskamp, Germany)-induced vasodilation of the brachial artery will be assessed by a
      high-resolution ultrasound vessel wall tracking device with a 10 MHz linear array transducer
      . FMD of the brachial artery is induced by release of a wrist cuff inflated 50 mmHg above
      systolic pressure for 5 minutes. After sublingual GTN application, used as
      endothelium-independent stimulus, the diameter will be recorded every 30 seconds for 6
      minutes.

      Multifiber recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity will be obtained from the peroneal
      nerve posterior to the fibular head with tungsten microelectrodes. The sympathetic nervous
      activity will be measured continuously together with ECG, respiration rate and blood
      pressure. Baroreceptor modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate would
      be assessed by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside.

      The goal of this study is to assess a slimy substance that settles/deposits along blood
      vessel wall. This slimy substance is called plaque. Plaque could be made up of fat, calcium
      or both. Plaque deposition narrows the vessels. This leads to decreased blood flow to various
      parts of body. Blood vessels include vessels that supply to heart (coronary), vessels to
      brain (carotid), vessels to kidneys (renal) and vessels to legs (femoral). Decreased blood
      flow causes symptoms such as brain stroke, heart attack, leg pain. Similarly individuals at
      risk of cardiovascular disease can have certain markers elevated in their blood that can be
      measured by simple blood tests.

      High or increased plaque deposition is seen in neck vessels of cancer patients who received
      radiation to chest or head and neck as part of their cancer treatment. Cancer survivors are
      at increased risk of plaque development and are therefore called high-risk population.
      Exercise +/- fat lowering medicine can potentially decrease plaque deposition and statins are
      one of the several fat lowering medications.
    ",Accelerated Atherosclerosis in High Risk Population Groups: An Assessment by Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,"
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the leading causes of suffering and death amongst
      the American population. While an ever-increasing number of cancer survivors have a favorable
      outcome due to advances in cancer treatment; cancer survivors remain at high risk of
      developing CVD at an early age. There is scant information available on the pathogenic
      process that contributes to cardiovascular threat amongst cancer survivors and little is
      known about the interventions, which may interrupt or decrease the risk of CVD in this
      population. Importantly, early-subclinical markers may substantially precede clinical
      markers.

      The objective of this project is to accurately determine the constituents and characteristics
      of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
      in cancer survivors; at different data intervals: before and after administration of
      treatment (medical and life style modification) and then correlate contrast agent dynamics
      with serum markers of inflammation and other tests of cardiac or vascular dysfunction, where
      available.

      The proposed study involves 100 asymptomatic patients who received prior chest or head and
      neck radiation therapy (HNXRT) as part of cancer treatment. MRI data (direct assessment of
      atherosclerosis) would be correlated with indirect measures of atherosclerosis (blood
      surrogate markers & metabolomics).

      The investigators intend to conduct an initial baseline MRI, blood tests (to correlate with
      surrogate markers of inflammation) and other tests whenever available of cardiac or vascular
      dysfunction. This cohort will be followed up with medication and/or life style modification
      regimen for a period of initially18 months and subsequently at 36 months. A repeat of all
      baseline studies (MRI and blood tests) would be performed as part of the 18 and 36-month
      follow-up. The plaque characteristics found at MRI will be correlated with results of blood
      tests (baseline, 18 and 36 months) and changes in one or both will be the expected end point
      of the study.

      of tranexamic acid (TXA) with hyaluronic acid (HA) in reducing swelling, bruising and pain
      after facial injection. This will be done by comparing HA to HA+TXA in participants

      always have the same type of injection performed bilaterally in order to maintain symmetry.
      This provides a unique opportunity where participants can serve as their own controls.
      Participants will be injected with HA on half of their face and the other half of the face
      will be injected with HA+TXA. Swelling, bruising, pain, and overall satisfaction will be
      assessed using participant self-reported surveys, physician surveys, and review of medical

      This is a Prospective Pilot Single Arm study on prolotherapy for the treatment of patients
      with pain due to Partial Rotator Cuff (RC) Tears of the Shoulder.

      The aim of this trial is to study the effects of injected glucose on injured or degenerative
      RC tears of the shoulder. Glucose is not recognized by the FDA for this purpose but is used
      in 2 main concentrations: 50% solution to treat hypoglycemia and 5% solution for fluid
      replacement.

      In the prolotherapy group, 20% dextrose will be injected into 4 locations of the affected
      shoulder. In the active control group, patients will receive a single injection of
      methylprednisolone into the subacromial bursa and 3 saline injections overlying the tendons.
    ",Prolotherapy for the Treatment of Partial Rotator Cuff Tears,Rotator Cuff Tear,Rotator Cuff Injuries,"
      Prolotherapy treatments have been used since the 1950s for the treatment of weakened or
      damaged soft tissue and cartilage. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated an anabolic
      response leading to thickened collagen tissue following treatment. Prolotherapy has been used
      to treat various tendinopathies, non-specific low back pain whiplash injuries, and partial
      ligament and tendon tears. Injection solutions used in the past include P2G (phenol,
      glycerine and glucose), sodium morrhuate and simple dextrose. Today, most prolotherapists use
      simple dextrose as an off-label treatment. Current treatment methods of the RC have several
      short-comings. Steroid injections, the most commonly applied treatment today for RC tears,
      have a short term benefit at the very most and have been found, when repeated, to lead to
      deterioration in pain, function and even tendon structure. Surgery is expensive, requires a
      long rehabilitation program, and has a very significant re-tear rate. In addition, studies
      are not conclusive regarding its effectiveness as compared to conservative treatment for the
      treatment of RC tears. No prolotherapy studies have been performed in the treatment of
      partial RC tears. Considering the extent of this endemic disorder, it was decided to explore
      prolotherapy for the treatment of partial rotator cuff tears.

      • Patients will be referred from local community clinics both by orthopedic surgeons as well
      as from family physicians. Patients will have received a steroid injection into the
      subacromial bursa and will have failed to respond.

      Patients will receive 3 monthly treatments all under ultrasound.

      25 patients will be recruited to this Pilot study. It is impossible to make an accurate
      estimation of the sample size of the trial needed as no prolotherapy study has been done
      specifically on partial RC tears.

        -  Patients with partial tears of less than 1 cm measured in a thorough ultrasound
           examination either in length or in width in any of the rotator cuff tendons are eligible
           for the trial.

        -  Patients will sign a consent form. They will rate their pain NRS score out of 10 prior
           to treatment and fill out (hopefully) an Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) Questionnaire. (The
           principle investigator has translated this questionnaire into Hebrew and has received
           approval from Oxford University for use in this research).

        -  Dr. Wende will perform all treatments under ultrasound in both groups, up to 3
           treatments in each patient.

        -  The radiologist evaluating pre and post treatment ultrasound scans will be blinded to
           the dates of the exam.

        -  Before the first treatment, an ultrasound scan of the shoulder will be performed by a
           musculoskeletal radiologist in Hadassah.

        -  4 points within the shoulder will be injected. Structures to be injected will include
           the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons as well as the inferior
           glenohumeral ligament. 20% dextrose and 0.5% lidocaine will be injected.

        -  All patients will be followed up by an unbiased, independent investigator 1, 6 and 12
           months after the last treatment at which time the NRS pain score is questioned and an
           OSS questionnaire is filled out.

        -  6 months after the last treatment, patients will have a repeat ultrasound scan of the
           shoulder 6 and 12 months after the last treatment, the range of shoulder motion will be
           examined by an independent investigator.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which pulmonary embolism (clot) can be

      along with standard anticoagulant therapy as compared to the standard of care anticoagulant

      The OVERALL OBJECTIVE of this investigation is to determine whether very low-dose intravenous
      tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA] (24 mg) + standard anticoagulation therapy
      (intravenous heparin) for treatment of acute PE (pulmonary embolism) in intermediate-high
      risk patients will have superior clot lysis (breakdown of clot) by chest CTA (computed
      tomography angiography) at 24 ± 6 hours post infusion compared to standard of care treatment
      alone. Acute intermediate-high risk PE patients are those with acute symptoms <14 days),
      simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI)>0, normal systemic arterial blood
      pressure (>90mmHg) without vasopressor support, elevated biomarkers (troponin or BNP), and
      evidence of RV dysfunction (right ventricular to left ventricular ratio>0.9).The study is
      planned to evaluate the reduction in clot burden based on the obstruction index using the
      Refined Modified Miller Score (RMMS), improvement in right ventricular (RV) function, and
      overall safety in the two treatment groups. 40 Subjects with intermediate-high risk PE
      (hemodynamically stable PE with a RV/LV ratio ≥ 0.9, elevated biomarkers, and sPESI>0) will
      be recruited and randomized to one of two treatment groups: 24mg of systemic (IV) tPA + IV
      unfractionated heparin versus saline placebo + IV unfractionated heparin. After delivery of
      the systemic (IV) tPA/placebo, patients will continue IV unfractionated heparin therapy for
      at least 24 hours. If there is no evidence of active bleeding nor significant hemoglobin drop
      (i.e., ≥ 2 mg/dL), patients will be transitioned to standard dose apixaban, 10 mg twice-daily
      x one week followed by 5 mg twice-daily for at least 6 months. Some patients will require
      indefinite apixaban therapy based on patient-specific factors, including unprovoked nature of
      PE event, and/or persisting DVT/PE risk factors. Finally, consideration will be given for
      decreasing the apixaban dose to 2.5 mg twice-daily after 6 months. Apixaban was selected as
      the anticoagulant of choice due to its very favorable bleeding profile in large clinical
      trials, which is an important consideration when prescribing an anticoagulant following
      systemic thrombolysis. Within 24 ± 6 hours post study drug infusion, a repeat chest CTA and
      echocardiogram will be performed. sPESI will also be calculated at this timepoint.At Day 30,
      180 and 365, all subjects will have clinic visits which will include a physical exam, repeat
      echocardiogram if previous echo was abnormal, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), quality of life
      questionnaires, assessment of adverse and bleeding events and a review of concomitant
      medications including compliance with apixaban. At Days 3, 7, 90 and 270, a remote health
      check will occur via telephone or email assessing adverse and bleeding events, alongside a
      review of concomitant medications (including an assessment of compliance with apixaban).The
      standard of care for patients with submassive PE is to either receive anticoagulant therapy,
      EKOS (Catheter Assisted Thrombolysis) or thromboectomy. tPA is given at the FDA approved dose
      (100mg) occasionally at doses much higher than our study proposes. PatientS with PE will have
      the initial CTA, echocardiogram and lab work as standard of care. The follow up CTA is
      usually standard of care at Day 30 and the follow up echocardiograms are considered standard
      of care if the previous echocardiogram was abnormal.The study is being done as a proof of
      concept that low dose tPA is effective in clot lysis and will result in far less risk than
      the FDA dose. If our study achieves its aims, the research will advance clinical practices in
      treating pulmonary embolism by reporting the safety of lower dose tPA and opening
      opportunities to further explore the use of lower dose tPA to improve patient safety and
      outcomes.

      The investigators plan to compare complication and success rates between two methods of
      ultrasound guidance for biopsy of liver lesions, contrast-enhanced and the current protocol
      without contrast.
    ",Prospective Analysis of Value of Contrast-enhanced Sonography During Biopsies of Focal Liver Masses,Liver Biopsy,,"
      As a major oncology and hepatology center, the investigators perform about 3-5 guided
      biopsies for liver tumors weekly. Ultrasound is the preferred modality for imaging biopsies
      due to its ability to visualize and position the biopsy needle in real time with high
      accuracy and safety, is nonionizing, and is quicker compared to other techniques, especially
      CT-guided biopsies. The failure rate of ultrasound guided liver biopsies (including cases
      where biopsy was declined to be performed due to lack of lesion visibility) is about 10%. By
      comparison, in the investigators' practice genotyping of metastatic tumors, with multiple
      core biopsies, is often requested for entry into oncology trials, and failure of tumor
      genotyping after biopsy is estimated to be about 30%.

      Recently, the first ultrasound contrast agent was FDA-approved for characterization of liver
      lesions [sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (Lumason, Bracco Diagnostics, Monroe
      Township, NJ)]. The microbubble agent is deemed safe, including in cardiac failure patients
      and those with chronic airway obstruction. Injecting microbubbles may allow better
      visualization of lesions and adjacent vasculature by enhancing the microvasculature and
      adjacent vessels and potentially reduce incidence of failed biopsy or bleeding complications.
      In addition, determination of necrotic regions in a lesion may allow better direction of
      biopsy.

      Yet there is limited literature on the use of ultrasound contrast agents for improving
      targeted liver biopsies. The investigators intend to prospectively assess the non-diagnostic
      biopsy and complication rates in a group of patients who undergo contrast-enhanced
      ultrasonography (CEUS) using microbubbles at the time of biopsy. The investigators will then
      compare the results from this group with the failure and complication rate from a control
      group of patients undergoing the standard US-guided biopsy procedure. Over 12 months the
      investigators expect to perform approximately 200 biopsies. Power analysis suggests that 125
      patients in both contrast-enhanced sonography and control groups, each, are required. The
      investigators should be able to enroll sufficient patients in 18 months

      Epclusa® is a pan-genotypic, once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection containing the NS5B- polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF, nucleotide
      analogue) 400 mg and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir (VEL) 100 mg.

      For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be
      problematic. In addition, HCV patients that are hospitalized (at intensive care units) due to
      severe illness (co-infections/ liver failure) might not be able to swallow medication.
      Therefore it is useful to know whether it is possible to administer SOF/VEL through a
      different route, like a feeding tube.

      In daily practice, information about the safety and efficacy of crushed tablets is lacking
      which might result in interruption or discontinuation of expensive HCV therapy. However, it
      is not recommended to interrupt treatment because there is no evidence about the efficacy of
      the therapy after discontinuation (and restart).

      Currently, patients and healthcare professionals are crushing SOF/VEL tablets without
      information about efficacy and safety. Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of
      a drug formulation, crushing tablets can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs.

      It is important to know whether pharmacokinetic parameters are influenced by crushing of
      tablets; both a decrease and an increase in exposure may occur. A decrease of the plasma
      concentrations of SOF and/or VEL potentially reduces the therapeutic effect of the drugs.
      Higher doses or switching to other HCV-drugs might be needed. In contrast, in case a higher
      Cmax,ss and/or exposure occurs there might be an increased risk of toxicity.

      As a result, crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available data.

      Snake bite Envenomation is a Public Health Problem especially for tropical and subtropical
      countries. The WHO estimates 40 000 annual deaths in the world for this cause. In México the
      Ministry of Health estimated 3 882 cases on 2005, being the age of 15-44 the most affected.
      There are not official numbers of mortality, although the thought is that there are few cases
      of death, most of them related with a delay on treatment.

      There are a broad variety of clinical presentations depending on many factors such as
      species, snake bite variability or patient conditions. Proteolytic action of venom produces
      amines and vasoactive peptides such as bradykinin, histamine and serotonin which cause
      capillary lesions with anticoagulant effects. Coagulopathy is one of the most important
      systemic consequences. The Dry Tube Test has been proposed as an indirect test to evaluate
      coagulopathy related to this pathology.

      Some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) take nebulised treatments to
      ease the symptom of breathlessness, including the drug ipratropium. Nebulised bronchodilator
      drugs are taken up to 4 times through the day, and this can take up to 15 minutes each time.
      Although the treatment isbe effective, patients report that the time taken to set-up and use
      the nebuliser can be a disincentive to regular use. By contrast, an inhaler device is easy to
      use following appropriate instruction, and takes only a few seconds to administer. Inhaled
      tiotropium is a once daily treatment taken by inhaler which has been shown to be effective in
      COPD. We wish to assess whether inhaled Tiotropium as effective as nebulised ipratropium in

      Tiotropium and ipratropium bromide are both antimuscarinic bronchodilators, licensed for the
      treatment of COPD with a similar side-effect profile. Tiotropium administered by an inhaler
      device (Handihaler®) has been shown to be superior to placebo and inhaled ipratropium bromide
      in patients with COPD, in both short term and longer term studies. The superiority of inhaled
      tiotropium over inhaled ipratropium bromide has been demonstrated for lung function tests and
      also for measures of health status. It is not known however if inhaled tiotropium is superior
      to ipratropium bromide administered via a nebuliser.

      We wish to examine whether inhaled tiotropium is as effective and safe as nebulised
      ipratropium bromide in patients with chronic stable COPD.

      Design The study will be a randomised, crossover study. The patients will not be blinded to
      the therapy but the technician performing the pulmonary function tests will be blinded to the
      patients' therapy.

      Duration The length of the study for each patient will be 12 weeks.

      Patient group Patients would be recruited from the population of patients supplied with a
      nebuliser from the respiratory department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients will be
      identified from those regularly attending the out-patients department and who have stable
      disease. Patients who frequently admitted to the respiratory ward with exacerbations of their
      disease will be excluded. Patients will be recruited at the rate of 2 per week. The study
      will be a single site study.

      Following consent the patients would be asked to complete the St George's respiratory
      questionnaire, undergo brief spirometry and a general heath/satisfaction questionnaire,
      including the baseline and transitional dyspnoea index. Patient demographics will be
      collected including; age, sex, duration of COPD, smoking history, height, weight, concurrent
      therapy inhaled and oral.

      The patients would then be randomised to either remain on their nebulised ipratropium for a
      further 6 weeks or to be commenced on inhaled tiotropium via the HandiHaler. Patients
      commenced on tiotropium would be given instruction on how to use the new inhaler and be told
      not to use their nebulised ipratropium. All other medication would remain the same. The
      patients randomised to ipratropium would be instructed on continue to take their nebulised
      ipratropium as before. All patients would be issued with a diary card on which they would
      record their pattern of nebuliser use, symptoms, adverse events and any additional medication
      required eg antibiotics. Patients will also be asked to record any health resource use, eg
      visits to their GP or admission to hospital on the diary card. A compliance check in the form
      of a capsule count will be undertaken.

      At the end of the six weeks the patients would again undergo brief spirometry, and complete
      the St George's respiratory questionnaire and a general health/satisfaction questionnaire. At
      this point the patient's therapy will be crossed over, such that those who were taking the
      inhaler would now take the nebuliser and vice versa. There will be no wash out period between
      arms of the study, since comparisons will be made between baseline and the end of each period
      of treatment for lung function and questionnaires, and diary cards will be analysed only for
      the final 4 weeks of each treatment period. Those patients to commence on tiotropium would be
      given instruction on how to use their inhaler and those restarting ipratropium would be asked
      to take their nebulised therapy as before. All patients would be issued with a diary card on
      which they would record their pattern of nebuliser use, symptoms, adverse events and any
      additional medication required eg antibiotics. Patients will also be asked to record any
      health resource use, eg visits to their GP or admission to hospital on the diary card.

      At the end of the second 6-week period the patients would again complete the St George's
      respiratory questionnaire, undergo brief spirometry and a general heath/satisfaction
      questionnaire as before. A compliance check in the form of a capsule count will be
      undertaken.

      At the end of the study patients will be asked which therapy was preferred and a
      recommendation will be made to their GP depending on their preference.

      Details of the patient's last dose of inhaled therapy will be recorded at the time of
      spirometry.

      Patient numbers The number of patients to be included in the study is 45. The patient numbers
      are based on a 90% statistical power to detect a mean change of 0.2L in FEV1 between visits 2
      and 3 as a result of treatment, using a 5% significance level paired test. This justification
      is based on previous studies which conservatively indicate the standard deviation of FEV1
      values to be 0.4L. Statistical analysis will be undertaken for differences in the mean FEV1
      values between visits 2 and 3 using a paired design and parametric testing. Results will be
      presented using the differences in means between treatments and the associated 95% confidence
      interval. Other response variables will be similarly analysed for evidence of any difference
      in treatment effect, with analysis of diary cards only for the final 4 weeks of each
      treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of esmolol, a drug which is commonly
      administered during surgery to help control blood pressure and heart rate, on postoperative
      pain levels and requirements for pain medication.
    ",Esmolol Infusion During Laminectomy: Effect on Quality of Recovery,Laminectomy,,"
      A common practice used to control autonomic responses during surgery is to administer
      beta-blockers intraoperatively. This practice has been shown to effectively blunt autonomic
      responses to intraoperative events. Several studies have shown that administration of
      beta-blockers can decrease intraoperative anesthetic requirements. Additionally, it has been
      demonstrated in several studies that intraoperative beta-blocker administration may actually
      decrease postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements, although these results are not
      entirely consistent. The mechanism by which the decrease in postoperative pain and narcotic
      requirements occurs is unclear. It has been postulated that esmolol may itself possess some
      analgesic-like properties, as was suggested by studies performed in rodent models. It has
      also been postulated that perioperative beta-blockade may attenuate the neuroendocrine stress
      response to surgery, thereby decreasing inflammatory responses in tissues; however, this
      theory was not supported by a study in which stress hormone levels were measured in patients
      who received beta-blockers and compared to a control group. Several studies which
      investigated the effects of beta-blockade on postoperative pain and opioid requirements
      compared the beta-blocker treatment group to an opioid treatment group, and did not include a
      true control group in which no treatment was given. Therefore, it is unclear whether the
      decrease in postoperative pain and opioid requirements in these studies was due to a true
      effect of the beta-blockers or whether it was due to an effect of the opioids.

      Therefore, the investigators propose a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study
      in which the investigators will compare an esmolol infusion treatment group to a normal
      saline infusion control group with regards to the effects on postoperative pain and opioid
      requirements. By setting up the study in this manner, the investigators will be able to
      clearly evaluate the effects of beta-blockers on postoperative pain scores and opioid
      requirements. The investigators chose to use esmolol both because it has a short half-life,
      so it is easy to titrate and administer as an infusion, and also because it is selective for
      beta-1 receptors, so deleterious effects of intraoperative hypotension should be minimized.
      The investigators chose to perform the study on patients who are undergoing single-level or
      double-level laminectomies because prior studies have investigated the effects of
      intraoperative beta-blockers on patients who are not chronic pain patients, and the
      investigators would like to research whether the results which have been suggested by prior
      studies are also applicable to patients who may have chronic pain, as this is the patients
      population that is most likely to experience high pain levels following surgery, and may
      benefit the most from reduction of postoperative pain levels.

      Long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a supportive, rather than curative, therapy for
      patients with severe short bowel syndrome (SBS). Because of the complications (liver and
      kidney dysfunction, bone demineralization, nutrient deficiencies, catheter sepsis) and costs
      (>$100,000/ patient/year) associated with this therapy, researchers have attempted to
      identify a safe, cost-effective alternative treatment modality. Various surgical procedures
      (including bowel transplantation) have been explored; however, these options currently offer
      limited clinical efficacy and significant morbidity and mortality. In contrast, a
      non-invasive therapy utilizing a growth factor (growth hormone - GH) and a bowel-specific
      nutrient (glutamine - GLN) in combination with an individualized oral diet (GH+GLN+Diet) has
      recently been shown to significantly enhance nutrient absorption and eliminate or reduce TPN
      requirements in patients with severe SBS.

      This open-labeled, single-center trial with a total enrollment of 30 patients with severe SBS
      will examine the safety and effectiveness of a lower dose (0.05 mg/kg/day) of growth hormone.
      Thirty-two subjects have previously been studied at the Nutritional Restart Center in
      Massachusetts utilizing a higher dose (0.1 mg/kg/day) of growth hormone and identical
      treatment parameters as described in this protocol. The University of Nebraska Medical Center
      and the Nutritional Restart Center have agreed to pool the data from both studies and analyze
      the data according to the same primary efficacy variable. Subjects recruited to the
      lower-dose growth hormone group will be matched, using specific clinical criteria, to
      patients in the higher dose growth hormone group. The primary efficacy variable will be the
      change in volume of TPN infusion/week and frequency of TPN infusions/week at 6 months
      following discharge compared to baseline.

      After a 3 day, baseline evaluation at The Nebraska Medical Center to determine pre-treatment
      TPN requirements and to assess the specific indices of nutritional and hydration status and
      kidney and liver function, and physical functioning capacity, patients will begin to receive
      lower dose GH (0.05 mg/kg/day) in combination with GLN (30 grams/day, orally) and the
      individualized oral/enteral diet. Treatment will last for a minimum of 23 days and a maximum
      of 54 days. Duration of treatment will be tailored to the patients' individual needs (e.g.,
      understanding and acceptance of the modified diet, successful weaning of TPN). Patients may
      return to their home to continue receiving the GH treatment, provided they are tolerating the
      GH injections and understand how to properly administer the injections.

      1. To elucidate the therapeutic role of levothyroxine on the patient with atypia of
           undetermined significance (AUS) goiter, we would design a prospective, open label and
           non-randomized trial to verify the therapeutic effects on goiter with AUS by means of
           TSH (Thyrotropin; Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) suppression related reduction of goiter
           volume with subsequent alleviation of previous cytological malignant tendency. During
           following for 1-2 years after therapy with simultaneous monitor of possible adverse
           effects of levothyroxine (eltroxin), we collected blood samples and gathered all
           necessary data as well as performed thyroid sonography with fine-needle aspiration (FNA)
           for the subjects. Furthermore, we would finish our individual study for each enrolled
           subject if his/her condition exhibited the criteria of primary end point: reduced goiter
           volume under sono >15% or cytology: benign for 2 times; operation for thyroidectomy, CAD
           attack, refractory arrhythmia, newly DM (Diabetes Mellitus), etc.

        2. To re-evaluate the current prevalence of goiter within Taiwanese adults, we recruited
           all patients who presented possible thyroid related symptoms, such as unexplained body
           weight loss with increased appetite, palpitation, hand tremors, neck swelling,
           hoarseness and abnormal sensation over throat. Only the patients with goiter proven by
           thyroid sono in euthyroid status without other preexisting major disorders can be
           enrolled in our trial to undergo open label, non-randomized study.
    ",The Role of Levothyroxine on Goiter With Atypia of Undetermined Significance,Goiter,Goiter,"
      The prevalence of goiter in Taiwanese adults was found to be 19.4% in males, 33.6% in females
      and 25% in total about 20 years ago even though there was no iodine-deficient area reported
      in Taiwan. The result implied that goiter not only became a quite common disorder, but also
      deserved further investigation, particularly since 0.7% of goiter would be diagnosed as
      thyroid cancers by means of fine-needle aspiration (FNA). However, the recent research
      indicated 5-15% of results after fine-needle aspiration directly disclosed malignant
      cytology. On the other hand, about 80% of initial results of FNA would appear non-malignant
      cytology. The most common feature of them was found to be indeterminate cytology, which
      refers to 15-30% of FNA specimens. The indeterminate cytology included follicular or Hurthle
      cell neoplasm as well as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS). Based on the revised
      American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for Patients with Thyroid Nodules, people
      would be referred to visit surgeons for surgical intervention if their reports of FNA
      demonstrated either Hurthle cell neoplasm or follicular neoplasm without autonomously
      functioning nodules; instead, population with AUS goiter only received observation for a
      period of time for following. Otherwise, they would be arranged to undergo surgical
      manipulations if any evidence of malignancy was suspected. There has been lack of sufficient
      studies to offer therapeutic options for the patient with AUS goiter around the world up to
      the present, especially in Taiwan. Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessary operation
      performed upon the patient with AUS goiter and provide another effective treatment for them,
      a well-designed, prospective clinical trial will be warranted on the patient with AUS goiter.

      To achieve the goal, the pathophysiology of goiter required to be understood at first.
      Although the actual etiology of goiter was uncertain, TSH (thyrotropin) has been regarded as
      a major factor to induce its formation up to now. To attenuate the growth-tropic effects of
      TSH, levothyroxine suppression therapy had been administered in the past to treat goiter,
      particularly about the goiter with colloid nodules. Successful reduction of goiter volume was
      found in some published papers while others did not verify the therapeutic effects of
      levothyroxine. However, the fact that goiter with size under thyroid sonogram more than 1cm
      required to be further examined indicated reduced volume of goiter may offer benefits
      including amelioration of previous malignant tendency especially in AUS goiter through TSH
      suppression therapy though some studies indicated routine suppression therapy of benign
      thyroid nodules in iodine sufficient populations is not recommended At first, patients who
      aged 20 to 70 with thyroid dysfunction related manifestations as goiter, palpitation or hand
      tremors would be recruited while they visited MET OPD (Out-Patient Department) and then they
      would be arranged to undergo thyroid sono as well as receive thyroid functional tests during
      screening periods before the study. The patients would be eligible for the interventional
      trial if their thyroid sonography demonstrated goiter and their thyroidal function revealed
      euthyroid status. After careful investigations of subjects' associated histories as family
      histories, drug histories and diet habits, the patients would be actually recruited for the
      clinical trial with the signed informed consent. Initially, the enrolled subjects would be
      classified into two major groups as solitary nodular goiter and multiple nodular goiter.
      Subsequently, two subgroups would be identified from each major group by presence of
      autoantibody of thyroglobulin or not. Thereafter, the patients would be asked to comply with
      the guidelines of ATA (American Thyroid Association) for advanced evaluation , fine needle
      aspiration and following if they indeed present with either goiter with more than 1 cm in
      size or less than 1 cm with regard to typical malignant characteristics under thyroid
      sonography, such as heterogeneous, hypoechoic, increased peri-vascularization, tall than
      wide. Furthermore, patients with history of family MTC (Medullary Thyroid Cancer) or contact
      of radiation or radiation therapy would be arranged to under FNA, too. The patients with
      first FNA disclosing AUS (atypia of undetermined significance) would be arranged to receive
      FNA again for confirmatory examination one month later and soon later those patients with
      positive findings of AUS twice would be allowed to take eltroxin for TSH suppression therapy.
      On the contrary, the patients would be assigned to the groups who will receive traditional
      observation and following of thyroid sonography as well as thyroid functional tests. These
      observed patients would receive surgical interventions if their FNA showed malignant
      potentials as NUCLEAR GROOVING， MICROFOLLICULAR FOCI，Hurthle cell, etc.

      As to the studied patients with consecutive FNA reports indicating AUS twice would be
      arranged to take levothyroxine (eltroxin, 0.1 mg) for therapy and its dosage would be
      adjusted carefully after 2 weeks per each OPD visiting. Optimal therapeutic goals would be
      regarded as subclinical hyperthyroidism and constant concentrations or dosages of eltroxin
      would be achieved in 2 months. Thereafter, the studied subjects would be arranged to receive
      thyroid sonography and FNA 3 months later and other necessary blood biochemistry studies for
      following. All following information would be recorded well and completely. The primary
      endpoint means: reduced goiter volume under sono >15% or cytology: benign*2 times; operation
      for thyroidectomy; CAD attack; refractory arrhythmia; newly DM. The pathology of all FNA
      during the clinical trial would be judged by the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid

      Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of the treatment of hepatitis C infection with
      pegylated interferon and ribavirin, and is a major cause of treatment discontinuation.
      Armodafinil is an FDA approved stimulant medication for the treatment of narcolepsy and
      shift-work sleep disorder. This is a randomized placebo controlled study to determine whether
      patients assigned to armodafinil have fewer missed doses, dose reductions or treatment
      discontinuation due to side effects in the first 12 weeks of treatment for hepatitis C
      infection than do placebo patients. Placebo patients are offered 14 weeks of open label
      armodafinil after Week 12.
    ",Armodafinil for Patients Starting Hepatitis C Virus Treatment,Hepatitis C,"['Hepatitis A', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis']","
      Four million Americans have chronic hepatitis C (HCV), and 30% of HIV+ patients are
      co-infected with HCV. Until May 2011, the standard treatment for HCV was the combination of
      alpha interferon (injected weekly) and ribavirin (daily pills) (IFN/RBV) for 48 weeks in
      order to achieve sustained virologic remission (cure). HCV treatment initiation was low,
      often because of concern about severe treatment side effects as well as high rates of
      virologic failure. Among the minority of medically eligible HCV+ patients (with or without
      co-morbid HIV/AIDS) who actually began treatment with IFN/RBV, side effects cause substantial
      attrition (about 20% by Week 12, 40% by Week 24). The most common adverse events are flu-like
      symptoms, of which fatigue is most prominent. Depressed mood is also common (mostly somatic
      symptoms).

      Two new medications, telaprevir and boceprevir (protease inhibitors) have been successful in
      treatment of HCV in clinical trials, and both were approved by the FDA for those patients
      with genotype 1 HCV, and are marketed as of May 2011. One of the new drugs will be added to
      the current regimen for genotype 1 infection. Because both drugs are protease inhibitors,
      which develop rapid resistance when administered alone, they must be added to the current
      standard of care rather than replace it. This is expected to vastly increase willingness of
      doctors to recommend treatment, and for patients to agree to treatment. The investigators
      expect that most hepatologists will recommend, and patients agree to the addition of one of
      these medications from now on. However, it should be noted that both commonly cause fatigue
      if it isn't already present because of HCV itself, or peginterferon or ribavirin. The major
      adverse event associated with telaprevir is rash, and with boceprevir, anemia.

      This is a 14-week placebo controlled double blind trial of armodafinil for patients about to
      begin HCV treatment, starting armodafinil or placebo 2 weeks prior to initiation of HCV
      treatment. Patients are recruited from the hepatology clinics at the respective sites.
      Randomization is 1:1. Placebo patients who continue HCV treatment are offered 14 weeks of
      armodafinil starting at Week 12 of HCV treatment when the armodafinil/placebo blind is
      broken.

      Patients will be seen weekly for the first 4 weeks to titrate armodafinil dose and manage
      side effects, if any, and then biweekly, with telephone contact on the intervening weeks
      through Week 12. After that, monthly telephone calls through Week 24 will be conducted with
      patients randomized to armodafinil, and biweekly visits with placebo patients beginning
      armodafinil at Week 12.

      The primary outcome measures concern non-adherence to INF/RBV treatment: 1) missed doses; 2)
      dose reductions, and 3) attrition due to side effects. Secondary outcomes include ratings of
      fatigue on the Fatigue Severity Scale, depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire
      (PHQ-9), and quality of life on the Endicott Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction

      No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yet been performed comparing different treatment
      options for AmpC or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. During the last 10 years we have seen
      an exponentially increasing rate of carbapenem resistance worldwide, including Australia and
      New Zealand. The investigators urgently need data from well-designed RCTs to guide clinicians
      in the treatment of antibiotic resistant Gram-negative infections. The investigators face a
      situation where a commonly used antibiotic for these infections (meropenem) may be driving
      carbapenem resistance. For this reason, the investigators are seeking to compare a
      carbapenem-sparing regimen with a carbapenem for the treatment of these infections. Formal
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of generic antibiotics in the treatment of infection is of
      immense clinical and public health importance, and no formal trial has yet been conducted to
      address these issues. The international collaboration between teams of clinician researchers,
      some of whom are leaders in their field, makes it highly likely that the outcomes of this
      trial will have a significant impact on clinical practice.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that piperacillin/tazobactam (a carbapenem-sparing regimen)
      is non-inferior to meropenem (a widely used carbapenem) for the definitive treatment of
      bloodstream infections due to third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli or
      Klebsiella species.
    ",RCT Meropenem vs Piperacillin-Tazobactam for Definitive Treatment of BSI's Due to Ceftriaxone Non-susceptible Escherichia Coli and Klebsiella Spp.,Bloodstream Infections,"['Infections', 'Sepsis']","
      Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. are common causes of bacteraemia, and may acquire genes
      encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases (1). ESBL or AmpC
      producers are typically resistant to third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, but
      susceptible to carbapenems (1). Observational studies have been performed evaluating
      antibiotic choices for ESBL producers (2-9). In no study has the outcome of treatment for
      serious infections for ESBL producers been significantly surpassed by carbapenems (2-9).

      Despite the potential advantages of carbapenems for treatment of ceftriaxone non-susceptible
      organisms, widespread use of carbapenems may cause selection pressure leading to
      carbapenem-resistant organisms. This is a significant issue since carbapenem-resistant
      organisms are treated with ""last-line"" antibiotics such as colistin. Some new beta-lactam
      antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors, which are active against ESBL, AmpC and some
      carbapenemase producing organisms, are in advanced clinical development (10). However, these
      antibiotics are likely to be expensive and may best be held in reserve for infections where
      there are no alternatives. Therefore, we see a need for establishing the efficacy of a
      generically available alternative to carbapenems for serious infections.

      The susceptibility of ESBL producers and AmpC producers to piperacillin/tazobactam is less
      predictable than that of carbapenems. By definition, ESBLs are inhibited by beta-lactamase
      inhibitors such as tazobactam (1). However, E. coli or Klebsiella may produce multiple
      beta-lactamase types some of which are resistant to inhibition by tazobactam. Additionally,
      in some cases outer membrane protein loss may contribute to resistance to tazobactam. By
      definition, AmpC is not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as tazobactam. However,
      despite these limitations, approximately 50% or more of ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli
      or Klebsiellae remain susceptible in vitro to piperacillin/tazobactam (1).

      No randomised controlled trials have yet been performed comparing different treatment options
      for ceftriaxone resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The largest observational study with an
      analysis by treatment outcome was published in February 2012 by Rodriguez-Bano and colleagues
      (9). They performed a post-hoc analysis of six published cohorts of patients with bacteraemia
      due to ESBL producing E. coli. Two nonmutually exclusive cohorts (empirical therapy and
      definitive therapy) were constructed and analysed separately. In both cohorts, carbapenems
      were not superior to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLBLIC).

      This study is designed to determine the relative effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone
      (Suboxone) pharmacotherapy versus naltrexone pharmacotherapy for treatment retention, relapse
      prevention and opioid craving reduction among opioid-dependent adolescents and young adults.
      The investigators hypothesize that naltrexone treatment is as effective as
      buprenorphine/naloxone for these treatment outcomes.
    ",Comparison of Buprenorphine/Naloxone With Naltrexone in Opioid Dependent Adolescents,Opiate Addiction,Opioid-Related Disorders,"
      Context: Standard treatment of opioid dependence in adolescents is detoxification and
      counseling, which results in relapse in 20-50% of patients. Alternative medical treatments
      include buprenorphine and naltrexone that have not been well investigated in adolescents and
      young adults. Buprenorphine has previously been shown effective in the treatment of opioid
      dependence in adolescents in one study in the United States as compared to detoxification.
      Although naltrexone treatment results in low compliance in adults, it is effective in
      combination with a strong social support network that exists in adolescents that live with at
      least 1 parent/guardian.

      Objective: To compare the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacotherapy with naltrexone
      pharmacotherapy on treatment retention, relapse prevention and craving reduction among
      opioid-addicted adolescents and young adults.

      Design: 2-arm Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Pharmacotherapy Clinical Trial.

      Setting: The study will be conducted in an outpatient treatment facility Participants: The
      participants will be those who 1) are between 16-25 years old, 2) have clear evidence of a
      substance use disorder with opioid dependence, and 3) live with at least one parent.

      Baseline data collection: Data collected at baseline will include (with examples),
      demographics (age, gender, race), substance use history (type of substances used, duration of
      use, routes of abuse), co-existing medical problems (seizures, hepatitis C), prior mental
      health problems (prior treatment, diagnoses), prior substance abuse treatment (outpatient,
      inpatient), socioeconomic variables (educational level, occupation, employment history),
      criminal history (number of arrests and convictions, total amount of time spent in jail or
      prison), family history (first degree relatives with substance use disorders) and scores on
      psychometric testing (DAST, opioid craving score).

      Outcome data: Four main outcomes will be examined: Retention in treatment, self-reported
      opioid craving, self-reported drug use with urine toxicology confirmation. Retention in
      treatment (1-180 days) will be measured by the date that participant was last seen by study
      personnel or date when participant completes study following the date of enrollment. Opioid
      carving (1-10) will be measured by a 10 point visual analog scale. Self-reported drug use
      (days to first use and percent days abstinent) will be measured by time line follow back.
      Urine toxicology (yes/no) will be determined at baseline and monthly at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
      months follow-up.

      Data analysis: Outcome variables will be compared between the two groups using t-tests or
      chi-square tests as appropriate. A Kaplan-Myer survival analysis will be used to describe
      participant participation. Predictors of poor outcomes will be identified using a
      case-control design in which those with poor outcomes (the ""cases"") will be compared to those
      with successful outcomes (the ""controls"") using multivariate techniques (logistic
      regression).

      Current effective dressings for burn wounds contain silver (nanoparticulate or ionic),
      hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, sulfa agents, chlorhexidine, iodine or other dilute
      antiseptics meant to provide some measure of antimicrobial protection. However, all of these

      The effect of varenicline, an alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor partial agonist on excessive
      daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease will be studied in a randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial with a within-subject crossover design.
    ",Varenicline Treatment for Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson's Disease,"['Parkinson Disease', 'Disorders of Excessive Somnolence', 'Sleepiness']","
      Sleep disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease and include excessive daytime sleepiness
      that has been reported in up to 50% of patients. Relatively little therapeutic research has
      addressed the problem of excessive daytime sleepiness and current treatment is largely aimed
      at reducing the dose of dopaminergic medication while trying to maintain sufficient motor
      control which unfortunately often fails. Apart from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, a
      decrease in cholinergic projections to the brain arousal areas may be at least partly
      responsible for the occurrence of excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease.
      Smoking in narcoleptic patients diminishes sleep attacks and excessive daytime sleepiness ,
      thus one may hypothesize that nicotinergic stimulation of the brain arousal areas may improve
      excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease. Therefore the effect of varenicline, an
      alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor partial agonist, on excessive daytime sleepiness in
      Parkinson's disease will be studied in a placebo-controlled cross-over study.

      disorders. EPA is an essential fatty acid, which can be metabolized to DHA and is a component
      of the human diet if fish is consumed. Aripiprazole is a novel second general antipsychotic
      that seems to function as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT 1A
      receptors as well as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT 2A receptor. Since it has a
      favorable adverse event profile in adults, it is an attractive choice for the treatment of
      youth with bipolar disorder if proven efficacious. Although pilot research showed that
      omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy treatment resulted in improvement of manic symptoms, the
      improvement is less dramatic than that observed in trials of antipsychotics. We will test the
      safety and efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo as an adjunctive treatment to
      open-label aripiprazole in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.

      Thrombocytopenia occurs when a person's blood has a decreased number of platelets, which are
      cells involved in blood clotting. This condition may lead to uncontrolled bleeding and can be
      fatal. Thrombocytopenia commonly occurs with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or as a result
      of standard HCV treatment. Anti-D is an antibody approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-related thrombocytopenia. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of intravenous anti-D for the treatment of
      thrombocytopenia in patients with HCV infection who are starting or already undergoing
      treatment with peginterferon alfa-2 and ribavirin. This study will recruit HCV patients both
      with and without HIV co-infection.

      Peginterferon alfa-2 with ribavirin is the current standard of care for the treatment of HCV
      infection; however, severe hematologic effects, including anemia, leukopenia, and
      thrombocytopenia, may make this treatment less than ideal for patients with HCV. Medications
      to prevent or treat serious neutropenia and anemia have been established and are commonly
      used. However, thrombocytopenia remains a barrier to the effective treatment of HCV infection
      in some patients. Developing a more effective treatment for thrombocytopenia for these
      patients would decrease the risk of serious bleeding events. It may also improve HCV
      treatment outcomes by preventing dose modifications or discontinuations of peginterferon
      alfa-2 and ribavirin due to thrombocytopenia.

      Anti-D is an antibody to the Rh (D) antigen on red blood cells. When anti-D attaches to the
      Rh (D) antigen, immune-mediated destruction of platelets is prevented, helping to alleviate
      low platelet levels in people with thrombocytopenia. This study will investigate the safety
      and efficacy of anti-D for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in HCV patients currently on or
      starting standard HCV treatment. Both HIV infected and uninfected participants will be
      recruited for this study.

      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants in this study must be either currently on
      peginterferon alfa-2 and ribavirin treatment or initiating such treatment at the start of the
      study; these two medications will not be provided by the study. At study entry, participants
      will be given anti-D over a 30-minute infusion in an outpatient setting. Participants will be
      observed for any adverse effects for 1 hour postinfusion. Some participants may require
      additional doses of anti-D later in the study, depending on individual response to the drug;
      participants may receive 1 to 6 doses of anti-D. Efficacy of anti-D treatment will be
      assessed by absolute change in platelet count and the ability to sustain plaletet counts
      greater than 50,000 cells/microL during the study. Cytokine levels will also be monitored to
      gain insight on how anti-D may work with cytokines in platelet survival and clearance.

      Generally, study visits will occur at study entry and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. In patients
      who require additional infusions of anti-D, there will be additional visits scheduled for
      each additional infusion and a postinfusion visit occurring 1 week after each infusion. All
      study visits will include medication history and blood collection. A clinical assessment and
      a targeted physical exam will occur at study entry, Weeks 1 and 12, and at additional
      infusion and postinfusion visits, if applicable.

      Recent studies show that BCG vaccination reduces neonatal mortality by more than 40%. This
      effect cannot be explained by prevention of tuberculosis, which is very rare among infants.
      The protective effect of BCG vaccination is seen already within the first week. It seems that
      BCG provides a non-specific beneficial immune modulation - thereby reducing overall
      mortality. Mortality is very high among newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care
      unit. If BCG has immediate beneficial effects on the immune system, vaccinating children with
      BCG as early as possible may save lives. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a
      randomized trial among newborns in Guinea-Bissau, randomizing newborns admitted to the
      neonatal intensive care unit at the National Hospital 1:1 to BCG immediately or at discharge
      (usual practice).
    ",A Randomized Trial of Providing BCG Vaccination Immediately,Early Neonatal Mortality,,"
      Observational studies in high-mortality areas have shown that the BCG vaccine is associated
      with marked benefits in child survival. These results cannot be explained by prevention of
      tuberculosis, which is rare during the firsts years of life. These observations have recently
      been tested at the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau in randomized trials among
      low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) children. According to local practice, BCG is typically
      postponed in LBW infants until 4-6 weeks of age. Results showed that providing BCG at the
      time of discharge from the hospital compared with BCG later reduced neonatal mortality by
      more than 40%. The protective effect started already within the first three days. Based on
      verbal autopsies, BCG protected the children against neonatal septicemia and pneumonia.
      Recent immunological studies have indicated that BCG induces epigenetic changes which
      reprogram the innate immune system to increased pro-inflammatory responses against unrelated
      pathogens; hence, BCG may indeed have a non-specific beneficial effect protecting against
      other infections.

      BCG is recommended at birth by the World Health Organization (WHO), but is rarely given
      immediately at birth. In Guinea-Bissau, at the National Hospital's maternity ward, children
      are currently vaccinated at discharge. For children who are born healthy, this usually means
      1-2 days after the delivery. However, very small children and ill children are admitted to
      the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and often stay there for days to weeks before they
      are discharged - and only receive BCG at the time of discharge. The mortality among children
      in the NICU is alarmingly high - it was 14% (254/1877) among children admitted to the NICU
      from November 2007 to May 2013 (unpublished data). A substantial number of children that died
      had normal birth weight and high Apgar scores. In most cases the underlying cause of death
      was infectious diseases, which could potentially be affected by BCG vaccination. Hence, the
      present aim is to conduct a randomized trial at the NICU to study the effect of providing BCG
      immediately (intervention group) versus BCG at discharge (control group). The primary outcome
      will be mortality during hospital stay, with cause of death, growth and length of stay as
      secondary outcomes.

      HYPOTHESIS

      Providing BCG vaccination upon admission to newborn children in the NICU incubators, rather
      than at discharge, is associated with 40% reduction in mortality at the NICU for children
      weighing >1250 g.

      METHODS

      Setting

      The randomized trial will be conducted by the Bandim Health Project in Guinea-Bissau, at the
      NICU at the National Hospital Simão Mendes. The Bandim Health Project (BHP) maintains a
      health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in six suburban districts of the capital of
      Guinea-Bissau and covers approximately 102,000 inhabitants. All houses in the study area are
      visited monthly to register new pregnancies and births. All children below 3 years of age are
      followed through home visits every third month. The National Hospital where many women from
      the study area give birth is a few kilometers away. The BHP has worked at the hospital's
      maternity ward for many years, conducting trials of different health interventions and other
      observational studies to reduce infant mortality.

      Study design

      Children will be randomly allocated (1:1) to BCG at admission or at discharge (as per current
      standard of care).

      Enrolment procedures

      The BHP team is present at the maternity ward every day. The team will visit the NICU and
      identify children admitted since their last visit. The mother will have the study explained
      in the local language (Portuguese Creole), and also receive a written explanation in
      Portuguese. She will be briefly interviewed about background factors (education, previous
      deliveries, etc.). Anthropometric measures will be obtained and a Ballard score assessed by a
      trained nurse.

      Randomization

      Provided consent, the mother will draw a lot which indicates if the child will receive BCG
      immediately or BCG at discharge as usual. To ensure equal distribution of different
      categories of children and calendar time, randomization will be done in blocks within two
      groups of children; a) children at the NICU who are in an incubator (most severely ill); b)
      children at the NICU who are not in incubator (less ill, including also children born by
      caesarean section whose mother is indisposed). Randomization will further be stratified by
      sex and weight group (1250-1499g, 1500-1999g, 2000-2499g, 2500+ g) in blocks of 16.

      Intervention

      Immediately after randomization, children who were allocated to BCG vaccine will be
      vaccinated intradermally with 0.05 ml BCG vaccine (Statens Serum Institute, Denmark). The
      control group will receive BCG at discharge. All children will receive oral polio vaccine
      (OPV) at the time of BCG vaccination.

      The study is therefore testing BCG+OPV at admission to the NICU (intervention arm) vs.
      BCG+OPV at discharge from NICU (control arm). Same-sex twin pairs will receive the same
      treatment.

      Blinding

      The BHP team will be in charge of randomization and vaccination. These procedures will take
      place without the participation of the NICU staff. BCG vaccination leaves a small mark on the
      skin of the child, which vanishes quickly, leaving no sign until a papule is formed several
      weeks later. To further ensure blinding of hospital staff, a small gauze patch will be placed
      over the injection site in both groups, for the entire hospital stay.

      Follow-up

      -At the hospital

      The BHP team will visit the NICU every day and ascertain the vital status of all enrolled
      children and that the plasters have not been removed. All clinical and biological parameters
      registered by the NICU staff, including weight, temperature and respiratory frequency will
      also be recorded. The main outcome is survival during the stay at the NICU.

      -After discharge

      At the day of discharge, the BHP team will assure that all children randomised to the control
      group receive BCG and OPV before leaving the hospital. The children being discharged will be
      offered transport to their home. All included children included from Bissau will be followed
      for adverse events, survival, growth and morbidity with home visits after 3 days, 2 months, 6
      months and 12 months of age.

      -Statistical analysis

      The mortality data will be analyzed in Cox proportional hazards models. Due to the expected
      high number of twins, all analyses will be adjusted for interdependency between twins. We
      will analyze the overall effect of BCG on survival, and by cause of death. Length of stay and
      weight gain at discharge among surviving children will be analyzed using linear regression.
      To prevent bias which could arise if BCG was particularly beneficial for survival among the
      smallest children, control and intervention children will be matched based on birth weight,
      and pairs of children in which one child dies will be excluded from the analysis. There will
      be a natural variation in the time from birth to enrolment into the trial. All analyses will
      be adjusted for time from birth to enrolment. All analyses will be conducted stratified by
      weight group, sex and season (dry (Dec-May) vs rainy (June-Nov)), since we have previously
      observed that both factors may modify the response to BCG and other vaccines. It is a
      secondary hypothesis that the early effect is strongest for boys and in the dry season.

      Public health campaigns which also affect newborn children, for example polio vaccination
      campaigns, could interfere with the trial. If such campaigns are implemented also for
      children in the ICU, the children will be censored in the analysis at the time of the
      intervention. Likewise if there are strikes, shortage of electricity or other events which
      interfere with the health services, the children will censored in the analysis after
      discussion with the DSMB.

      -Sample size

      The NICU admits around 350-400 children per year who are placed in the incubators. Around 94%
      weigh more than 1250 g. The median length of stay is 6 days. With a mortality of 12%, we
      would need to enroll 1262 children to detect a 40% difference in mortality between
      BCG-vaccinated and BCG-unvaccinated children with 80% power and a significance level of 5%.
      This corresponds to 122 deaths. If mortality declines (as it has done over the last years in
      the BHP study area), the event number would have to be slightly higher; with a mortality of
      11% we would need to continue to 123 deaths to maintain the same power; if it declines to 10%
      it would be 124 deaths, etc.

      Based on this data, the investigators expect to reach the needed number of events during a
      period of 4 years, taking into account that some children will have died before they can be
      enrolled and some children will be too ill to be enrolled.

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study protocol has been approved by The Danish Central Ethical
      Committee and the National Ethical Committee in Guinea-Bissau. The trial will be registered
      at clinicaltrials.gov. In previous studies BCG was safe for LBW children and even more
      beneficial among the smallest children. A local clinical monitor and a Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed.

    ",Evaluating the Use of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in Total Joint Arthroplasty,Blood Loss,Hemorrhage,"
      Tranexamic Acid (TXA) is given to stop or reduce heavy bleeding. It works by stopping clots
      from breaking down and by decreasing unwanted bleeding. It is used in many types of surgeries
      to help reduce surgical complications such as blood loss and blood transfusions.

      In orthopaedic surgeries, such as in total hip and knee replacements, TXA has been shown to
      effectively reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements without an increased risk of side
      effects such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The ability to
      decrease blood loss is crucial, as other studies have shown that reducing blood loss
      decreases morbidity and mortality in patients.

      Although, many TXA dosing regimens have been studied - all of which have been useful at
      reducing blood loss and decreasing transfusion requirements - the best TXA dosing regimen and
      the most cost-effective method of TXA administration for patients have yet to be determined.
      Moreover, a thorough and rigorous study on the use and effects of topical and intravenous TXA
      and the effect of TXA on patient outcomes has yet to be conducted.

      Therefore, this research study aims to address those concerns in order to understand how best
      to use TXA to reduce surgical complications in patients undergoing total joint replacements.

      Leaking valves in the veins of the legs causes veins to become large and bloated. These
      swollen veins are called ""varicose veins"" and are a very common problem, affecting more than
      a third of all adults in the UK. Varicose veins reduce people's quality of life by causing
      problems such as pain, itching and restless legs. Varicose veins may also damage the skin
      over time causing problems such as bleeding, skin colour changes, eczema and even break-down
      in the skin which is called an ulcer. Newer, ""key-hole"" methods of treating leaky veins have
      been developed as an alternative to surgery and can be performed under local anaesthetic with
      the patient awake. Rather than cuts in the skin, these minimally invasive techniques are
      performed through tiny stab wounds; little larger than needle holes. The varicose vein is
      then destroyed from within, usually using heat to burn the inside of the vein. These
      procedures are popular; with a rapid recovery and a very high success rate. However these
      methods also require the vein to be surrounded by a large volume of dilute local anaesthetic
      which can to be slightly painful to administer. A technique called ""Foam sclerotherapy""
      involves the injection of a drug which has been mixed into a foam. This goes into the vein
      and causes it to stick shut. This procedure is near painless to perform as very few, small
      local anaesthetic injections are required; however the chance for a successful treatment
      first time are lower and patients may need to return for repeat treatments to successfully
      treat the vein.

      The aim of this study is to see whether the success rates for this technique can be improved.
      One method ""catheter directed foam sclerotherapy"" involves the delivery of the foam through a
      catheter (a long very thin tube), so that large lengths of vein can be treated through a
      single hole. The final method ""ClariVein"" again uses a catheter; but this time the catheter
      has a small wire on the end which spins around inside the vein; similar to an edge strimmer
      in the garden; except it irritates the vein: rather than cutting it. This irritation makes
      the vein more susceptible to the drug which can again be applied directly to the vein wall
      whilst it is still active. Early results show that this final method is very successful;
      however the equipment is more expensive than for the other two.

      This study will randomly allocate willing participants with varicose veins to receive one of
      these three treatments to see whether the two newer treatments can improve the success rates
      and quality of life improvements seen with foam sclerotherapy, whilst also allowing near
      painless treatment, without significant complications, at an appropriate cost.

      . Investigational Plan Study Design This is a single centre three armed parallel group study
      with equal randomisation. The trial will be conducted in the Academic Vascular Surgical Unit
      of Hull York Medical School based at Hull Royal Infirmary, a university teaching hospital.

      Target population The target population for this study are individuals with symptoms of SVI
      with ultrasound evidence of axial vein reflux and who have agreed to receive treatment for
      their axial vein reflux.

      Recruitment Each patient referred to the vascular service with symptomatic SVI is assessed.
      Patients who potentially meet the inclusion criteria will be made aware of this research
      study and provided with the appropriate information, including the patient information sheet
      (see appendix 1). Patients will be given an opportunity to think about the invitation to
      participate and discuss with family/friends or other healthcare professionals if desired.
      Patients expressing an interest in participation will be offered an appointment for a
      screening visit with a study investigator.

      Randomisation and Blinding Randomisation Participants will be randomised to one of the three
      treatments. Randomisation will be conducted by a sealed envelope system. Once enrolled in the
      study, efforts will be made to assess and manage all participants as outlined in the
      allocated treatment protocol until the pre-determined end-point of the study or until
      participant withdrawal. Following randomisation the participant's GP will be informed of the
      intended treatment modality Blinding Due to the nature of the procedures involved it will not
      be possible to blind the participant or clinical team as to which group the participant is
      allocated. Bias will be limited by the use of objective measurements, standardised protocols,
      use of patient reported outcomes and standardised assessor outcomes.

      Power Calculation In order to detect a clinically significant difference in technical success
      of 15% with a power of 80% and a significance of 5%; 73 participants per group will be
      required. Assuming a 10% drop out rate we therefore aim to recruit 80 participants per group.
      The study will therefore randomise 240 participants in total over the 3 study groups.

      Treatment Protocol All cases will be performed on a day-case, out-patient basis as per the
      standard practice in our unit by an experienced endovenous surgeon. For each participant, the
      investigating team will re-assess the inclusion and exclusion criteria, confirm the consent
      and undertake the procedure as per the protocol.

      Participants judged to be at high risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) due to the use
      of exogenous oestrogens, past medical history or a family history of VTE or thrombophilia or
      immobility will be given a single pre-operative dose of prophylactic molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH), in the absence of contraindications. All participants will have duplex assessment and
      marking using the same protocol with only the endovenous procedure differing.

      The sclerotherapy drug used will be Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate, also known as STD and
      marketed as Fibrovein® (STD Pharmaceutical Products, Hereford, UK). STD comes in different
      variations of concentration, for this trial we will use 3%, 1.5% or 1% STD depending on the
      procedure protocol. STD can be used as foam or as a liquid preparation which makes it ideal
      for our study. The STD used will be from routine stocks. It will be stored at room
      temperature in a suitably secure location in the ward, clinic or theatre. Careful records
      will be kept regarding which participants receive STD and its batch number Preoperative
      procedure The treatment aim is to eradicate any significant SVI present in the limb.
      Preoperatively the veins are marked by the surgeon using duplex-ultrasound with the patient
      standing. This will identify the extent and position of the refluxing axial vein alongside
      any incompetent perforating veins and varicose tributaries. The significant superficial
      varicose vein (GSV, ASV, SSV, GV) to be treated will have its length measured and noted. In
      addition, the average diameter of the varicose vein will be calculated via three transverse
      images of the vein (proximal, middle and distal) and noted. Potential areas to be punctured
      by cannulae may have local analgesia applied prior to treatment. The participant will be
      positioned supine on the operating table where in the Clarivein and Ultrasound Catheter group
      sterile precautions including disinfectant skin preparation and sterile draping will be
      employed, and the Foam Sclerotherapy and tributary treatment group skin disinfectant only.
      The ultrasound transducer will be prepared with a sterile covering and secured to the sterile
      drapes to allow sterile intra-operative ultrasound duplex scanning.

      Operative Procedure: Foam Sclerotherapy Group The axial vein will be cannulated under local
      anaesthesia with an 18G (green), 20G (Pink) or 22G (Blue) Intravenous cannulae under
      ultrasound guidance with the patient reclined in a supine position for GSV or ASV treatment,
      prone position if SSV or GV treatment. This will be performed at the lowest point of
      demonstrable reflux and throughout the length of the incompetent vein at 20cm intervals. Each
      insufficient tributary system will also be cannulated separately. Venous blood will be
      aspirated and the cannulae flushed with normal saline to confirm that each is inside the
      target vein. Local anaesthesia can be used at each puncture site prior to needle insertion if
      desired by the patient. Once the cannulae are secured the leg is elevated to empty the veins.

      The foam is then prepared by the Tessari technique by the surgeon. Two 2-ml syringes will be
      connected via a three way stop-cock tap and a 5 micron filter in series (Braun Medical,
      Sheffield, UK). The syringes will contain 1 part Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate 3% and 3 parts
      air. In practice 0.5ml of 3% STS will be drawn up against 2 ml of air. The foam will be
      produced by at least 20 passages from syringe to syringe through the filter.

      Up to 2ml of foam will be injected into each cannula under ultrasound control to observe
      venous spasm, followed by gentle massaging of the skin to propagate the foam through the
      segment of vein treated. The surgeon will also endeavour to prevent propagation of fresh foam
      beyond perforators and junctions into the deep venous system. The patient will be asked to
      dorsi-flex and plantar-flex their ankle several times to clear any foam which might have
      entered the deep venous system. At least 30 seconds will be left between each injection of
      foam. As per the European consensus guidelines a maximum of 12mls of foam will be used at one
      sitting32 33. Typical volumes of foam reported by Bradbury are 4-12ml in the GSV and 2-8 ml
      in the SSV34. After ensuring that the axial vein is treated the surgeon can then progress to
      the treating the tributaries and application of the dressings, as detailed below.

      Operative Procedure: Catheter Directed Foam Sclerotherapy (CDS) Group The straight segment of
      axial vein will be cannulated under local anaesthesia at the lowest point of demonstrable
      reflux and a guide-wire inserted to facilitate the placement of the catheter system. The
      access cannulae will be removed and replaced with a 5F introducer sheath over a guide. A
      Unifuse® (AngioDynamics, Cambridge, UK) catheter system will be deployed via the sheath.

      Unifuse® catheters available are 5F with either 45 cm or 90 cm lengths in combination with
      5cm, 10cm or 15cm long infusion patterns. The appropriate Unifuse® catheter will be selected
      and deployed through the introducer sheath and advanced to within 2cm of the junction or
      perforator at the upper limit of incompetence or the top of the incompetent segment in the
      case of segmental reflux. The catheter will be aspirated to ensure correct position and
      flushed with normal saline. Each tributary system will be cannulated as was the case in the
      FS group.

      A 1:3 foam of 3% STD will be produced as described for FS. At this point the patient will be
      repositioned into a Trendelenburg position (head up). The Unifuse® Self-Occluding ball wire
      will be inserted and the tip correctly positioned at 2cm from the junction under ultrasound
      guidance. As the internal diameter of the Unifuse® catheter is 1mm (3F) approximately 0.35ml
      of foam in the 45cm catheter or 0.7ml of form for the 90cm catheter will be injected to fill
      the dead-space. The appropriate volume of foam will be then be infused through the Unifuse®
      catheter during withdrawal under ultra-sound guidance. The catheter will be withdrawn the
      length of the infusion pattern following each injection. The surgeon will endeavour to
      prevent propagation of fresh foam beyond the perforators and junctions into the deep venous
      system. The maximum volume of foam used in one sitting is again limited to 12 ml, although
      the dead space in the catheter will be added to this. Once the varicose vein is treated the
      total volume of foam used is noted. After ensuring that the axial varicose vein is treated
      the surgeon can then progress to the treating the tributaries and application of the
      dressings, as detailed below.

      This study is designed to determine if one anaesthetic modality, either motor sparing nerve
      block or peri-articular local infiltration anaesthesia with infusion, is superior in
      providing postoperative analgesia following total knee joint arthroplasty and if the efficacy
      of analgesia affects TKA outcomes. These outcomes include pain and function for a period of
      up to 3 months, narcotic consumption, and specific non-pain complications, including cardiac,
      respiratory, central nervous system, thromboembolism, infection, nausea and vomiting and
      urinary retention.

      Economic outcomes will also be examined, including length of hospital stay, direct health
      care costs and patient satisfaction.

      Seventy patients of either sex with ASA physical status of 1-3, aged greater than 30 years
      scheduled for elective primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty will be the randomized to
      one of 2 groups. The patients will be identified by the surgeons and seen in the pre-admit
      clinic to obtain informed consent, and collect health and joint related data using SF-12,
      Knee Society Scores, and WOMAC surveys. The randomization will occur in the pre-admit clinic
      with a closed envelope system. This is not a blinded study for logistical reasons.

      Group 1: Control- Motor Sparing Nerve Block Continuous Motor sparing knee block (using 60mL
      of 0.5% Ropivacaine with 10 mg Morphine, 30 mg Ketorolac and 150 mcg of epinephrine as the
      initial bolus) initiated in the preoperative period in the block room by anesthesia as per
      the standard practice( 25mL for posterior knee infiltration, 5mL for LFCN, 25mL for adductor
      canal under the fasica lata, 5ML for intermediate cutaneous nerve of thigh) and continued
      until discharge. CADD infusion pump will deliver Ropivacaine 0.2% at a basal infusion rate of
      8 mL/Hr with no patient controlled boluses.

      Group 2: Intervention- Local Infiltration + Infusion Anesthetic Wound infiltration will first
      be completed per standard practice using 110mL of ropivacaine 300mg, ketorolc 30mg ,morphine
      10mg for infiltration. After, three peri-articular catheters (inserted into the suprapatellar
      pouch, anterior subcutaneous cutaneous tissue, posterior to the femur) will be inserted at
      the end of the case followed by periarticular infusion with CADD infusion pump delivering
      Ropivacaine 0.2% at a basal infusion rate of 8 mL/Hr with no patient controlled boluses

      All patients will receive sedation with fentanyl and midazolam titrated to effect during the
      initiation of spinals and MSNB blocks. All patients will receive intravenous sedation with an
      infusion of a mixture of propofol and ketamine titrated to effect during surgery. Patients
      will be discharged home following removal of the anaesthetic catheters and fulfilling
      criteria for discharge

      All patients will receive standard multimodal analgesia pre- and post-operatively.

      Pain scores, nausea/sedation, narcotic consumption, and any post-operative complications will
      be assessed and documented 6 hours post-op on the day of surgery. After this, pain scores
      will be documented twice daily till the end of pian study period (post-discharge day 4 and
      once more at 2 weeks post-op) and will be recored when at rest and with mobility (two VAS
      scores each assessment) . Nausea and sedation will be documented at time of assessment from
      the patient or nursing charts as well as the patient pain diary.

      The discharge criteria is as follows

        1. The patient should be able to take care of personal care, get in and out of bed, into
           and up from a chair, on and off a toilet and to walk with proper walking aids 70 m
           without time limit; ability to do five steps.

        2. Free of medical or surgical complications including urinary catheterization or need for
           blood transfusion

        3. Acceptable pain relief (NRS = 5/10) without any need for intravenous analgesics.

        4. No nausea/ vomiting; generalized weakness or dizziness.

        5. Knee flexion of 90 degreeed is optional but preferred.

      The patients will be assessed at 6 hours of arrival to PACU and at 9 AM and 2pm on POD 1. If
      the patients were not discharged on POD 1 , the readiness for discharge will be at 9 AM on
      postoperative day 2 subsequently. WOMAC scores, KSS scores and SF-12 will be collected at the
      Pre-admit clinic and will be repeated at 6 weeks and three months postoperatively. Block
      performance characteristics prospectively collected will include procedural time, success,
      number of attempts and complications such as persistent paresthesia and intravascular
      injection. Inpatient assessment by the research team as well as a pain diary for
      documentation following discharge will be used to collect data including numeric pain score
      on movement and rest at various time intervals (twice daily), the predominant site of pain,
      frequency of rescue analgesic consumption, total analgesic consumption, symptoms of sedation
      and nausea for up to 4 days post-discharge. Time to first physiotherapy session and their
      progress/ability to perform rehabilitation exercises daily will be documented. Regardless of
      the group the patient is randomized to, their anesthetic device (MSNB or LIA infusion) will
      be discontinued and removed in hospital prior to discharge. Time to discharge readiness and
      actual duration of hospital stay will be documented.

      Total patient involvement time is 3 months (from surgery to 3 month follow-up appointment).

      In hospital, adverse events will be retrieved from patient charts and nursing/physician
      documentation. Post discharge adverse events will be collected by the patient diary and at
      their 2 weeks, 6 week and 3 month post-operative follow-up. These will include occurrence of
      myocardial events, DVT, Pulmonary emboli, delirium, pneumonia, paralytic ileus,
      gastrointestinal bleed, new onset renal dysfunction and wound infection.

      Delayed or post- discharge adverse events and duration of narcotic therapy will be collected
      in the out-patient clinic at 2 weeks and at 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery at their
      follow-up appointment.

      Wound and prosthetic infections and the presence of chronic post-surgical pain will be
      recorded from the surgical follow up notes.

      This is a research study to determine if administering carboplatin at a slower rate when
      re-treating recurrent ovarian cancer patients prior to the development of a hypersensitivity
      reaction will decrease the frequency and severity of future hypersensitivity reactions.
    ",Slowed Carboplatin Infusion for Ovarian Cancer Patients Receiving Carboplatin Re-Treatment,"['Recurrent Ovarian Cancer', 'Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer']","['Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Hypersensitivity']","
      For women with recurrent ovarian cancer, re-treatment with carboplatin is frequently
      recommended. However, carboplatin re-treatment can result in an allergic or allergic-like
      reaction called a hypersensitivity reaction. Symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction can
      include, but are not limited to itching, rash, swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, chest
      pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
      diarrhea, palpitations, dizziness, confusion, and low pressure. Hypersensitivity reactions
      occur in 20-40% of women with recurrent ovarian cancer who are re-treated with carboplatin.
      At least half of the hypersensitivity reactions are described as moderately severe with
      symptoms of generalized rash, wheezing, facial swelling, difficulty breathing/shortness of
      breath, and hypotension (low blood pressure).

      Patients who suffer from a hypersensitivity reaction while receiving carboplatin and require
      additional therapy may receive future carboplatin infusions utilizing a ""desensitization""
      technique. A desensitization is when carboplatin is administered in slowly increasing amounts
      as an inpatient under the direction of the department of Allergy Immunology at Massachusetts
      General Hospital. A desensitization allows patient to safely receive carboplatin, but
      requires an inpatient hospitalization, which may be of significant inconvenience to some
      patients.

      As part of this study, the participant will continue to receive carboplatin as part of their
      standard therapy. The change would be instead of carboplatin being administered over a 30
      minute period, the carboplatin be administered intravenously according to the following
      schedule:

        -  First hour - Administer 1 percent of total dose

        -  Second hour - Administer 9 percent

        -  Third hour - Administer 90 percent

      Standard pre-medications will be administered immediately prior to the carboplatin infusion
      which will include of 20 mg of dexamethasone, 50mg of diphenhydramine, and famotidine 20 mg.

      The participant's medical record will also be reviewed to evaluate whether age, cancer
      stage/grade, number of previous carboplatin cycles, accompanying agents, and/or medical
      conditions have an effect on hypersensitivity reactions. The participant will also be asked
      to fill out a short optional form regarding race and ethnicity to evaluate whether or not
      these factors contribute to hypersensitivity reactions.

      If the participant experiences a hypersensitivity reaction, the study protocol will be
      discontinued. A standard blood draw for a tryptase (a blood test for an allergic reaction)
      will be obtained at the time of the reaction along with other discretionary laboratories
      recommended by your oncologist. The participant will then be referred to the Allergy
      Immunology Department if carboplatin is determined to be necessary for future treatment.

      In patients with heart attacks, the current standard of care is to restore blood flow through
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This is done using stents (metal meshes) that opens
      up blockages. Following PCI, standard preventative drug treatment includes the use of dual
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using both aspirin and a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor
      (Ticagrelor 90 mg twice a day or Clopidogrel 75 mg once a day) for one year to prevent
      clotting that can result in additional heart attacks, sudden clotting of stents or death.

      New studies have shown that there is a benefit to continuing DAPT beyond this one year mark.
      Longer-term DAPT has been shown to reduce ischemic events (heart attack, stroke) but increase
      the risk of bleeding. Present guidelines state that the decision to continue DAPT beyond the
      one year mark should be made on an individualized basis.

      The present study is a ""pilot study"" that seeks to compare Long-Term use of Ticagrelor (LTT)
      versus a Personalized Approach (PA). We will be recruiting patients who have been stable
      (free of ischemic or bleeding outcomes) on DAPT for 1 year after initial presentation with a
      heart attack.

      The PA group will use a modified DAPT score based on patient demographics to decide whether
      treatment is warranted. Patient will also undergo bedside genetic testing to identify
      potential at-risk genes. Those identified as carriers will be treated with ticagrelor while
      non-carriers will be treated with clopidogrel.

      The present study will determine whether a personalized approach will decrease bleeding
      versus an approach of universal ticagrelor use.

      The hypothesis is that patients receiving a personalized strategy will have a decreased risk
      of bleeding.

      In this randomized, controlled, observer-blinded study the investigators plan to evaluate
      ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) and ultrasound-guided thoracic erector
      spinae plane (TESP) block for postoperative pain management after unilateral total mastectomy
      without immediate reconstruction.
    ",Erector Spinae Plane Block Versus Paravertebral Block in Mastectomy,Postoperative Pain,"Pain, Postoperative","
      Despite substantial advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of pain and
      availability of newer analgesic techniques postoperative pain is not always effectively
      treated. Optimal pain management technique balances pain relief with concerns about safety
      and adverse effects associated with analgesic techniques. Currently, postoperative pain is
      commonly treated with systemic opioids, which are associated with numerous adverse effects
      including nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, pruritus, urinary retention, and
      respiratory depression. Use of regional and local anesthesia has been shown to reduce opioid
      requirements and opioid-related side effects. Therefore, their use has been emphasized. The
      advent of ultrasound guided regional anesthesia has brought more precision to these
      techniques, including the ability to visualize the anatomy, perform real-time navigation, and
      direct observation of local anesthetic spread, as it allows a greater degree of sensory and
      motor blockade. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) has been used for analgesia of the
      thoracic wall since it was first described in 1905. A relatively recent alternative to the
      TPVB is the thoracic erector spinae plane (TESP) block, which involves the ultrasound-guided
      injection of local anesthetic into the interfascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscle
      at the level of the transverse process. It results in a loss of somatic sensory sensation
      across multiple unilateral dermatomes due to local anesthetic mediated blockade of the dorsal
      and ventral rami of the spinal nerve roots. It is increasingly being used due to ease of
      placing the block and a perception of greater safety. It has been shown to provide pain
      relief from rib fractures, thoracotomy, and chronic neuropathic pain of the chest wall.
      However, to date, TESP block has not been compared with TPVB in regards to analgesia with
      mastectomy surgery, which has been extensively studied.

      The investigators hypothesize that TESP block will provide similar (i.e., non-inferior)
      analgesia compared to TPVB block while reducing the cumulative consumption of oral morphine
      equivalents during the 24h post-operative period. The two co-primary aims of the study are to
      compare a) pain scores at 2h post-operative period, and b) cumulative consumption of oral
      morphine equivalents during the 24h post-operative period. Secondary objectives include
      comparison between the group in terms of pain scores at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours
      post-operatively, as well as block-related morbidity (e.g.- pneumothorax), time to perform
      each block, and opioid-related adverse effects (e.g.- postoperative nausea and vomiting).

      Additionally, the clinical results of the two methods of revascularization will be carried

    ",Revascularization With BVS or CABG in Patients With Advanced CAD,Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease,"['Coronary Artery Disease', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Coronary Disease']","
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death among adult population in
      developed countries. Optimal method of revascularization of patients with multivessel CAD is
      still the matter of debate. Currently, there are two recognized methods: percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Both methods were
      compared in a number of studies, including several randomized trials. Most trials have left
      some doubts. First of all, none of them used functional evaluation of the stenosis. The
      decision regarding revascularization was based on angiographic results alone. The trials that
      have used fractional flow reserve (FFR) show no clear correlation between the degree of
      stenosis assessed angiographically, in the range of 50-90%, and its functional significance.
      In a randomized FAME trial, out of 1329 significant stenosis assessed anatomically, nearly
      40% revealed no functional significance. The study showed that coronary revascularization
      guided by FFR in multivessel stable CAD resulted in a smaller number of vessels stented, and
      hence fewer stent implantations. Such a strategy has improved patient clinical outcomes. In
      the group of patients undergoing revascularization based on fractional flow reserve
      significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was observed in 1- and 2-year
      follow up.

      Another weakness of former studies was the use of first-generation drug eluting stent (DES)
      showing an increased risk of restenosis and late and very late stent thrombosis. Many
      randomized studies documented superiority of new generation DES, with more biocompatible or
      bioresorbable polymer in terms of the incidence of MACE (SPIRIT, LEADERS). Recently, fully
      bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) have been introduced into routine clinical practice.
      Preliminary results of the ABSORB EXTEND trial demonstrated similar efficacy and safety of
      the Absorb BVS, as compared with the best-in-class its metallic counterpart XIENCE. Since the
      complete resorption of the scaffold requires two-three years, the greatest clinical benefit
      will be observed a couple of years after implantation. Total bioresorption of the scaffold
      not only allows to restore the physiological function of the vessel, but also eliminates a
      number of adverse events associated with the presence of permanent metallic prosthesis in the
      vessel wall, such as very late stent thrombosis and the neo-atherosclerosis development.

      Intravascular imaging with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) is widely considered the gold standard for scaffold optimal implantation, although
      currently it is not routinely used. The use of intravascular imaging techniques before and
      after BVS implantation may help to avoid inadequate expansion and apposition of the scaffold
      struts. Subintimal calcifications detected with IVUS or OCT require adequate lesion
      preparation before stent deployment. This is particularly crucial for patients receiving BVS,
      where the goal of lesion preparation is to facilitate scaffold delivery, reduce plaque shift
      and to allow optimal scaffold expansion. OCT with its greater resolution enables to assess
      the scaffold integrity, apposition and the presence of thrombus or edge dissections.

      Based on the ABSORB EXTEND trial there are some suggestions for longer dual antiplatelet
      therapy duration and more potent agents than clopidogrel (i.e. ticagrelor) regardless of
      clinical presentation, particularly in the first months after BVS implantation. Ticagrelor in
      the PLATO trial has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardio-vascular
      death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to clopidogrel. In patients treated with
      PCI, it also reduces the rate of stent thrombosis. Statins are the most widely used
      LDL-lowering drugs in high-risk patients. It is recommended to achieve a greater than 50%
      reduction in LDL levels. Treatment goal for fasting LDL-cholesterol is < 70 mg/dl (1.8
      mmol/l). In comparison with other lipid-lowering agents, rosuvastatin is the most potent
      agent to achieve the required reduction of LDL. Rosuvastatin in maximal tolerated dose is
      indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and revascularization procedures.

      RELEASE-BVS study is the first trial that takes into account all of the following important
      aspects:

        -  stable advanced coronary artery disease: 3-vessel disease or significant left main (LM)
           stenosis, suitable for either PCI or CABG with proven ischemia in stress CMR;

      Treatment with prednisolone can be used as a proof of concept to investigate the possibility
      of immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia. It is expected that daily treatment
      with prednisolone in addition to antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptoms and
      improves cognition, as compared to placebo. The investigators propose to investigate the
      effects of administering the corticosteroid prednisolone versus placebo in addition to
      standard antipsychotic medication in patients with early stage schizophrenia or related
      disorders, hypothesizing that a decrease in the overall low-grade cerebral inflammation due
      to prednisolon treatment will be expressed as a decrease in overall symptom severity.,

      recent-onset psychosis patients. Finally, the investigators aim to determine whether indirect
      immunological parameters of the hypothesised low grade inflammation status in schizophrenia
      are shifted due to the addition of prednisolone.

      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled add-on design. A placebo-controlled design was
      chosen in order to differentiate between clinical effects of prednisolone and effects
      associated with experimental treatment, such as induced expectations of participants.
      Prednisolone or placebo is provided next to existent antipsychotic medication as the
      investigators do not intend to replace existing treatment, this study being a Proof of

      This is a prospective randomized controlled pilot study in traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      patients who are sedated with either propofol or midazolam to compare the cytokine response
      and neuropsychological outcomes with and without elevated blood alcohol levels.

      Sedation is part of the standard treatment in patients with a TBI and has been proposed as a
      neuroprotective intervention in head-injured patients. Sedative regimens, such as midazolam
      and propofol, are not standardized and it is unclear whether sedation has a significant
      impact on recovery and outcome. A review of propofol versus midazolam in mechanically
      ventilated patients shows evidence that both provide effective sedation but there is lack of
      data to support one sedative over the other.

      Cytokines are released in response to tissue injury and act to generate a variety of
      physiologic responses. The cytokine elevation has been correlated with the extent of tissue
      injury. This study will compare the cytokine distribution patterns at specific posttraumatic
      time points in patients with a TBI sedated with either propofol or midazolam. Additional
      analysis will compare the cytokine response in patients whom had elevated blood alcohol
      levels with those with normal levels. Neuropsychological testing will also be performed to
      determine the extent of brain injury and recovery.
    ",A Comparison of Propofol Versus Midazolam to Sedate Critically Brain Injury; Measurement of Cytokine Response and Assessment of Function,Traumatic Brain Injury,"['Brain Injuries', 'Brain Injuries, Traumatic', 'Wounds and Injuries']","
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness, length of time from cessation
      of sedation till extubation, recovery time, duration of admission to the ICU, recovery of
      brain function, cytokine response, and complication rate of propofol versus midazolam when
      used for sedation in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with or without elevated
      blood alcohol levels. Since this type of trauma patient will require significant medical care
      upon admission to the emergency room (ER) and the family will be concerned about the
      injuries, the patient and/or family will not be approached about the research study during
      this time. At the earliest possible time following neurointensive (NICU) or intensive care
      (ICU) admission, an informed consent will be obtained from the patient. Depending on the
      severity of the head injury, the patients may not be able to sign an informed consent. In
      this case, the consent will be obtained from next-of-kin or a legal guardian. No
      interventions or study research will be conducted on the patient until the consent is
      obtained.

      Standard blood panels are drawn for every trauma patient regardless of whether or not the
      patient is a participant of the research protocol, including blood alcohol levels. During the
      trauma workup in ER, it is standard of care to draw an extra vial in case additional lab
      tests are needed. After consent is obtained, the research team will obtain the extra vial
      from the Sparrow Lab to perform cytokine and blood cell phenotype measurements for the
      research study. Typically 0.5-1.0 ml of whole blood is needed for these measurements and that
      can be taken from the standardized EDTA tube that is drawn on admission. This small amount of
      blood sample would otherwise be discarded. Plasma cytokines and cell phenobype IL-1, IL-3,
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-¦Á, TGF-¦Â, G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, FGF, and IGF-II will be
      performed by Luminex-based mutiplex assay and ELISA. In addition to the ER analysis, left
      over blood will be used from the EDTA tubes at 24 hours, day 3 and day 7 after admission.
      These additional measurements will be taken from the routine morning laboratory blood draws
      which are done on all intubated patients to evaluate electrolytes. No additional blood will
      be drawn for the research and the study will only be using left over blood already drawn for
      standard of care labs that are done on all intubated patients.

      Once consented, the patients will be randomized to treatment group by random allocation
      process using Research Randomizer (Urbaniak, G. C., & Plous, S. Version 3.0 Computer
      software]. The patient and family will be blinded to which sedation is given. Nurses and
      physicians will not be blinded as they will be administering the sedatives. Although the
      patients will receive randomized sedation, these patients would be administered either
      propofol or midazolam even if they were not included in this research. The only modification
      for research purposes is the randomization of sedation medication by the randomizer rather
      than the physician. Currently, the providers in the research team do not have a preference of
      one type of sedation medication over the other.

      Once randomized, patients allocated to the propofol group will be initiated with a 0.5-1
      mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by repeated 10-20 mg doses at variable intervals (approximately 15
      s, at the discretion of the physician/nurse) until an appropriate level of sedation will be
      achieved (NICU protocol), which will be subsequently titrated to achieve a target Richmond
      Agitation-Sedation Scale (+4 = combative to -5 = unarousable) (Sessler et al. The Richmond
      Agitation-Sedation Scale.Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002; 166:1338-1344). Nurses will note
      pre-sedation levels based on the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. While undergoing
      sedation, target sedation will be defined when the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale meets a
      score of -4 to -5. Patients randomized to the midazolam group will be initiated with 0.5-1.0
      mg with incremental dosing at intervals of approximately 1-3 min until a level of sedation
      will be achieved at a target Richmond Agitation-Sedation scale sedation score (per NICU
      protocol).

      Management of all trauma patients include a careful history taking for alcoholism with
      referral for further evaluation or treatment when indicated, and determination whether other
      drugs are also being used. All patients with an elevated alcohol level require a medical
      social service consultation and all patients with a TBI require a neuropsychology
      consultation, both consultations are standard of care. The neuropsychological testing
      conducted after extubation is also standard of care. The neuropsychological evaluations will
      be measured based on the following assessments: intellectual functioning, language
      processing, visuospatial processing, attention, concentration, verbal learning, memory,
      executive functioning, sensory, perception, motor, strength, and personal assessment. The
      level of impairment will be based on a scale from zero to seven. Data will be collected until
      the patient is discharged from the hospital. The clinical records from the neuropsychologist
      will be reviewed to analyze the progression of the patient's outcome. Similar to all trauma
      patients, the patients enrolled in this study will be offered continued care with
      neuropsychology as well as the option to withdrawal all care if competent to make independent
      decisions.

      Throughout the study consciousness will be measured using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) from
      the time of presentation to the ER and two times each day until the patient is discharged
      from the NICU or ICU (routinely done on TBI patients). The Injury severity scores (ISS) will
      be recorded from admission (done on all trauma patients). Recovery of consciousness will be
      determined by measurement of the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III
      modification of the Glasgow coma score to allow for scoring of the verbal component in
      intubated patients. Patients will be judged to be awake when the Glasgow coma score was > or
      = 12.

      The following will be recorded from the Sparrow medical record for each patient: gender, age,
      sex, weight, primary diagnosis, significant co morbidities, blood alcohol level at admission,
      intracranial pressure measurements (standard of care for TBI patients), time of starting and
      finishing of the sedation, total amount of medications given, any restraint required,
      additional oxygen required, resuscitative measures required, time of transfer out of the
      unit, and time of discharge.

    ",Effects of InFat™ Product on Stool Biochemistry and Stool Characteristics in Formula-fed Term Chinese Infants,Healthy,,"
      In human breast milk, and in most infant formulas more than 98% of this milk fat is in the
      form of triglycerides, which contain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids esterified to
      glycerol. Fatty acids in human milk-fat have a highly specific positional distribution on the
      glycerol backbone and this specific configuration is known to have a major contribution to
      the efficacy of this nutrient absorption.

      Palmitic acid (C16:0), the major saturated fatty acid, is predominantly esterified to the
      sn-2 (β) position of the triglyceride in human milk. In contrast, palmitic acid in standard
      infant formulas is esterified to the sn-1 and sn-3 positions.

      Infants fed with high sn-2 palmitic acid formula had softer stools, less constipation and
      better calcium absorption as compared to standard infant formula.

      InFat™ is structured triglyceride fat ingredient with high levels of palmitic acid at sn-2
      position.

      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that feeding Chinese term infants, with
      formula having proportion of palmitate in the sn-2 position comparable to human milk, reduces
      calcium-soaps formation.

      There is limited guidance on the optimal management of buprenorphine perioperatively and both
      buprenorphine discontinuation and continuation are acceptable standards of care.
      Buprenorphine continuation at low analgesic dosing is also accepted, however is not provided
      as a potential treatment strategy by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
      Administration (SAMHSA). There is the risk of inadequate pain control necessitating opioid
      escalation when buprenorphine is continued. Preliminary clinical observations support
      buprenorphine continuation at low analgesic doses (8mg) as it adequately facilitates
      postoperative pain management without interrupting opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment,
      however to date, no prospective trial has investigated this treatment strategy in comparison
      to full dose buprenorphine continuation. Since optimal perioperative dosing strategies remain
      unknown, the purpose of this study is to investigate if buprenorphine continuation at
      analgesic dosing is superior to full dose buprenorphine continuation in individuals
      presenting for elective surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether buprenorphine continuation at analgesic
      dosing is superior to full dose buprenorphine continuation in individuals presenting for
      elective surgery. Adults scheduled for elective surgery who are taking ≥12mg buprenorphine
      for OUD treatment will be eligible for this study. Enrolled participants will be randomized
      to receive either a reduced analgesic dose of buprenorphine (8mg) or to continue
      buprenorphine on the day of surgery without dose reduction. The primary outcome of interest
      is postoperative pain scores. The secondary outcomes of interest are opioid consumption,
      opioid dispensing up to 30 days following the surgical procedure and OUD related symptoms,
      including opioid withdrawal, cravings and relapse. The investigators hypothesis is that there
      will be a clinically significant increase in pain scores when buprenorphine is continued in
      full compared to when it is continued at a lower analgesic dose. Clinical significance will
      be defined as a difference in composite pain scores of greater than 20% between groups. The
      investigators also hypothesize that opioid consumption and opioid dispensing will be greater
      with full dose buprenorphine continuation compared to low-dose continuation.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether Altabax (retapamulin ointment, 1%) is
      effective in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal
      colonization. The hypothesis is that the prevalence of MRSA increases as a function of
      increasing clinical exposure and that the topical antibiotic Altabax is efficacious in
      clearing MRSA nasal colonization. The prevalence of MRSA nasal colonization among Tulane
      University medical students and residents and physicians of Tulane Medical Center and Ochsner
      Medical Center will be investigated. A total of 300 subjects will be recruited for the study.
      After giving informed consent, subjects will be swabbed to obtain specimens for culture and
      asked to complete a short survey to assess risk factors. Swabs will be used to directly
      inoculate three types of plates: CHROMagar MRSA plates, Spectra MRSA plates, and TSA with
      sheep blood plates. After appropriate incubation, Staph latex slide tests will be done and
      then results confirmed with cefoxitin disk susceptibility testing. MRSA positive subjects
      will be offered a treatment protocol with the topical antibiotic Altabax (retapamulin
      ointment, 1%) to be applied as a thin layer to the anterior nares twice daily for 5 days.
      After the 5-day treatment is complete, subjects will be retested for the presence of MRSA at
      day 7, day 12, day 30, and day 90. For this portion of the study, all cultures will
      additionally undergo disk susceptibility testing for retapamulin, erythromycin, clindamycin
      (including D-test), trimethoprim sulfa, and mupirocin (5 mcg and 20 mcg disks). In addition,
      Etests for retapamulin and mupirocin will be done. Genetic isolates will be characterized by
      rep-PCR pre-treatment and post-treatment. Data will be analyzed for MRSA prevalence and risk
      factor associations with MRSA colonization. Of those subjects found to be MRSA positive, data
      from the follow-up cultures will be used to assess the efficacy of Altabax in clearing MRSA
      nasal colonization.

      future Trabeculectomy surgery. Group B receives 0.1mL MMC 0.01% subconjunctival injection
      intraoperatively at the site of Trabeculectomy and Group C receives conventional sponge
      delivery of MMC 0.02% intraoperatively. To avoid observer bias during postoperative
      evaluation of results, IOP staff obtaining measurements of IOP will be masked to the
      randomization allocation.

      All groups undergo conventional Trabeculectomy surgery (fornix-based) as scheduled, and the
      same routine follow up and post-op regimen will be scheduled for all three groups. Patients
      are routinely visited in the clinic at first day postoperatively, one week (+/-2 days), one
      month (+/-1 week), three months (+/-2 weeks), six months (+/-3 weeks) and finally at one year
      (+/-(4 weeks)). In each of these visits we will be assessing: Visual acuity, intraocular
      pressure, number and type of glaucoma medication, slit lamp examination of the anterior
      segment and fundus examination.

      Purpose:

      To obtain estimates of the effect on intraocular pressure and side effects of three delivery
      methods of Mitomycin C (MMC) compared among each other: preoperative subconjunctival
      injection of 0.1 mL MMC 0.002%, subconjunctival injection of 0.1 mL MMC 0.01%
      intraoperatively, and conventional sponge applied MMC (0.02%) during trabeculectomy surgery
      in patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma who did not have any filtering surgeries before.

      Objective:

      To obtain estimates for intraocular pressure reduction among three delivery methods of MMC
      compared among each other: preoperative subconjunctival injection, intraoperative
      subconjunctival injection, and intraoperative topical use during trabeculectomy surgery, and
      to report any associated adverse effects.

      There is no use of hypothesis testing in this pilot study.

      Alternative hypothesis:

      There is no use of hypothesis testing in this pilot study.

      The effect and safety of MMC subconjunctival injection either preoperatively or
      intraoperatively has been previously investigated in Pterygium surgery (Khakshoor H, Razavi
      ME, Daneshvar R, Shakeri MT, Ghate MF, Ghooshkhanehi H. Am J Ophthalmol. 2010
      Aug;150(2):193-8. Preoperative subpterygeal injection vs intraoperative mitomycin C for
      pterygium removal: comparison of results and complications).

      Previous studies comparing effectiveness of subconjunctival injection of MMC vs
      sponge-applied MMC have shown inconsistent results. In one retrospective study, Mitomycin-C
      applied by injection resulted in significantly lower IOP, and the need for fewer glaucoma
      medications, however description of methods is incomplete. (Lim MC. A comparison of
      trabeculectomy surgery outcomes with mitomycin-C applied by intra-Tenon injection versus
      sponge method. American Glaucoma Society 23rd Annual Meeting; 2013, San Francisco, CA). One
      retrospective study showed similar efficacy and safety of intraoperative MMC injection
      compare to sponge application in trabeculectomy surgery with overall lower IOP in the
      injection group and main advantages being a large surface area of exposure and a predictable
      dose of deliver when the injection was performed. No difference in postoperative
      complications between groups was observed. A small sample size (30) in each group might
      prevent finding statistical significant results. (Khouri AS, Huang G, Huang LY.
      Intraoperative Injection vs Sponge-applied Mitomycin C during Trabeculectomy: One-year Study.
      J Curr Glaucoma Pract 2017;11(3):101-106). A previous case report on preoperative
      administration of MMC for Trabeculectomy showed reduction of IOP with short follow-up (6
      months) Hung PT, Lin LL, Hsieh JW, Wang TH. Preoperative mitomycin-C subconjunctival
      injection and glaucoma filtering surgery. J Ocul Pharmacol Ther. 1995;11(3):233-241.

      One RCT with a follow-up of 3 years compared outcomes of intraoperative injection versus
      sponge-applied MMC and no significant difference in IOP was found however a more favorable
      bleb morphology was found in the injection group which is correlated with better function and
      long-term success of Trabeculectomy ( Esfandiari, Hamed et al. Treatment Outcomes of
      Mitomycin C-Augmented Trabeculectomy, Sub-Tenon Injection versus Soaked Sponges, after 3
      Years of Follow-up Ophthalmology Glaucoma , Volume 1 , Issue 1 , 66 - 74)

      In this study the comparison will be the timing and route of delivery of MMC in all three
      groups, having found inconsistent reports in the literature and very scarce data on the
      effect of preoperative subconjunctival MMC the investigators would like to further explore in
      this pilot study the effect of subconjunctival injection on IOP reduction for trabeculectomy
      at preoperative and intraoperative phases. Since there is no group receiving placebo, the
      inclusion of a sham injection will not affect the outcomes compared to GROUP C and could
      increase preoperative risks to patients. The same methodology has been applied in two
      previous randomized controlled trials. (Pakravan M, Esfandiari H, Yazdani S, et al. Mitomycin
      C-augmented trabeculectomy: subtenon injection versus soaked sponges: a randomized clinical
      trial Br J Ophthalmol 2017;101:1275-1280 and Khan F, Niazi S, Awais M et all. Effectiveness
      of Preoperative Subconjunctival Injection of Mitomycin-C in Primary Pterygium Surgery Journal
      of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan 2017, Vol. 27 (2): 88-91)

      Glaucoma patients who need glaucoma surgery, such as trabeculectomy, have ongoing damages
      that cannot be managed only with medication such as drops, and pressure reduction is
      absolutely crucial in preserving visual function in these patients, hence any possible action
      that can add to this reduction is valuable.

      On the other hand, there are several risks associated with the topical applied MMC usage at
      the time of surgery mainly due to the inability to precisely quantify the amount of MMC
      delivered by the sponge application which was shown to be far less with the injection of MMC
      by delivering a predicted volume either at surgery or before the surgery which are mentioned
      in the first two paper references.

      The selected concentrations for the MMC injection are based on pharmacological studies
      performed on ocular tissue in which the concentration achieved after subconjunctival
      injection was established.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled pilot study with a main objective
      of obtaining estimates of differences in IOP reduction among three methods of delivery of
      mitomycin C for use in trabeculectomy surgery.

      The injectors and patients are unmasked in this study while the evaluators are masked.

      This study will be performed at the Glaucoma Division of Stein Eye Institute-UCLA Los
      Angeles, CA.

      METHODS

      Patients who met inclusion criteria and had signed an informed consent will then be
      randomized into three groups as follows:

        -  Group A: Patients will receive a subconjunctival injection of 0.1mL MMC 0.02mg/mL which
           corresponds to 0.002% (a tenth of the concentration of conventional topical MMC use) at
           the site of future trabeculectomy surgery two to four weeks in advance. A follow-up
           phone call 1 week after the MMC injection will assess any side effects of the procedure.
           If side effects are reported by the patient an appointment will be schedule for a follow
           up in-office visit and appropriate treatment will be delivered. On the day of
           conventional trabeculectomy no MMC will be injected. Follow-up will be scheduled for one
           year.

        -  Group B: On the day of conventional trabeculectomy patients will receive a
           subconjunctival injection intraoperatively of 0.1 mL MMC 0.1mg/mL which corresponds to
           0.01% (half the concentration of conventional topical MMC use) at the site of
           trabeculectomy. Surgeon will irrigate the surface of the eye after MMC injection to
           remove any MMC that might have leaked out. Follow-up will be scheduled for one year.

        -  Group C: On the day of conventional trabeculectomy patients will receive MMC by applying
           a sponge soaked in 1mL of MMC 0.2 mg/mL (0.02%) for 1 minute to the site of
           trabeculectomy surgery followed by irrigation. MMC is standard of care for
           trabeculectomy surgery at UCLA. This differs from the proposed research because the MMC
           will be administered as an injection either two to four weeks before the surgery in
           Group A or intraoperatively in Group B rather than the usual topical administration on
           the day of surgery (Group C). Follow-up will be scheduled for one year.

      The concentration of MMC in each group were chosen according to the delivery method and the
      timing of exposition of the tissue to the MMC in order to prevent complications from
      overdose. Based on experimental studies on ocular tissues that evaluated the final amount of
      MMC delivered to scleral tissue and finding a similar result when using subconjunctival
      injection of 0.02% with immediate irrigation and 0.002% without irrigation, the investigators
      chose the latter for group A. Few studies evaluated MMC subconjunctival injection one month
      before pterygium surgery using 0.02% and 0.015% with a follow-up of 3 years establishing
      safety of this approach. For group B the investigators chose a similar methodology of a
      previous RCT comparing subconjunctival injection versus topical administration of MMC for
      trabeculectomy that used a reduced concentration of 0.01%.

      Data collection will be as follows: At preoperative visit, postoperative day one, one week
      (+/- 2 days), one month (+/- 1 week), three months (+/- 2 weeks), six months (+/- 3 weeks)
      and one year (+/- 4 weeks). The data will be recorded in the REDCap (Research Electronic Data
      Capture) software which has free access and allows for easy recording and uploading of
      imaging (VF, Optic nerve OCT, AS-OCT and bleb photography) for future analysis.

      In each of these visits, the following data will be collected: Visual acuity, intraocular
      pressure, number and type of glaucoma medication, slit lamp examination of the anterior
      segment, fundus examination and adverse events if present. Visual field and optic nerve OCT
      will also be included in the preoperative evaluation and at 12 months postoperatively.

      For better assessment of the bleb morphology, the investigators will include a clinical grade
      system, slit lamp photography, and AS-OCT [Anterior segment module of Spectralis OCT device
      (Heidelberg Engineering, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany)] of the bleb.

      For the clinical description of the bleb and a more standardized comparison of the
      morphological changes over time, the investigators included at every postoperative visit the
      description of the bleb using the Moorfields Bleb Grading System (MBGS) which captures more
      morphological features and regional vascularity compared to other systems. (Wells AP, Ashraff
      N, HalL RC et all Comparison of Two Clinical Bleb Grading Systems Ophthalmology
      2006;113:77-83).

      The bleb photography will be included at the Month 3 and Month 12 postoperative visits and
      AS-OCT at 1,3,6 and 12 Month follow-ups. The inclusion of AS-OCT allows for evaluation of the
      internal structure of the bleb that has been shown to have prognostic implications for
      outcomes of surgery. Kokubun T, Tsuda S, Kunikata H et all. Anterior-Segment Optical

      Block randomization:

      To ensure the balance of sample size between three treatment groups, block randomization is
      used for treatment assignment. Specifically, each block consists of 6 patients, including 2
      patients in each of three treatment groups, and all possible permutations of a sequence of
      treatment assignment for these 6 patients are generated, such as AABBCC, ABCABC, etc. A
      random number is then generated to select a block of treatment assignment for 6 patients
      among all possible blocks, and a sequence of such random blocks will form the sequence of
      treatment assignment for all patients after their enrollment.

      The Chairman of the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission reported at a recent US Senate
      hearing that asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sleep apnea are among
      the top 13 most frequent diagnoses leading to disability under the Department of Defense and
      the VA system statutes. Recent research finds that sleep apnea is more common among asthma
      and COPD individuals, and this may be caused by inhaled corticosteroid use. Many Veterans are
      currently using inhaled corticosteroids, and many more will be prescribed such medications,
      given their recent inclusion in international treatment guidelines. As such, this study
      addresses a critical need by researching the role of a potent inhaled corticosteroid in
      promoting sleep apnea, the determinants of this response, and the ways through which it
      occurs. Results from this study will form the foundation for future research aimed at
      expanding understanding of the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on the upper airway, as
      well as developing means to prevent or counteract them.
    ",Inhaled Fluticasone Effects on Upper Airway Patency in Obstructive Lung Disease,"['Asthma', 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea']","['Lung Diseases', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'Sleep Apnea, Obstructive']","
      BACKGROUND: Growing data suggest that patients with obstructive lung disease (OLD) such as
      asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased predisposition for
      obstructive sleep apnea, but the mechanism(s) remain unknown. One characteristic these
      patients share is use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). The investigators recently found a
      dose-dependent relationship of ICS use with high OSA risk. Furthermore, in a 16-week
      observational inhaled fluticasone (FP) treatment study, the investigators observed increased
      upper airway (UAW) collapsibility during sleep, as measured by the critical closing pressure
      (Pcrit), paralleling the improvement in lower airways obstruction, with the largest Pcrit
      deterioration in the subject with most sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) at baseline. These
      findings suggest an effect of ICS on the ""unified airway"" of steroid responsive patients and
      of those with more collapsible upper airways at baseline. The investigators also found a
      dose-dependent relationship of ICS with obesity. Based on their known effects, ICSs could
      deleteriously affect UAW collapsibility through inducing dilators' myopathy and fat
      deposition around the UAW. FP is the most potent and commonly used ICS.

      HYPOTHESIS/AIMS: The central hypothesis is that FP will increase UAW collapsibility (less
      negative Pcrit) and worsen SDB in steroid responsive patients with OLD and those with UAWs
      more susceptible to collapse at baseline, through alterations in tongue muscle function and
      fat accumulation in the UAW surrounding structures. To address this hypothesis, the
      investigators propose to test the effects of inhaled FP on: 1) UAW collapsibility during
      sleep and SDB severity, assessed by Pcrit, measured as we previously reported (1) and
      polysomnographic (PSG) measures. Exploratory aims will test the role of steroid
      responsiveness and baseline collapsibility as determinants of FP effects on Pcrit and SDB; 2)
      tongue strength and fatigability, and fat accumulation (fraction and volume, measured on MRI)
      in the surrounding UAW structures, measured as we previously reported (1,2).

      DESIGN: The investigators propose a proof-of-concept and mechanistic, randomized-controlled,
      parallel groups study of high (220 mcg, 4 puffs twice a day) vs. low (44 mcg twice a day)
      dose inhaled FP, followed by an 8-week wash-out period, in 58 steroid-naive subjects with
      OLD. Following baseline Pcrit, PSG, MRI and tongue function, subjects will enter a 2-week
      low-dose FP run-in, with subsequent randomization to either high- vs. low-dose FP, for 16
      weeks. At mid-period, Pcrit, tongue function and steroid responsiveness status (defined as 5%
      improvement from baseline in FEV1%) will be determined. At the end of treatment, Pcrit, PSG,
      MRI and tongue measurements will be taken. Then, subjects will enter an 8-week wash-out that
      ends with repeat Pcrit and tongue function assessments.

      SIGNIFICANCE: Millions of people, including many Veterans, are treated with ICS for OLD, and
      among those with COPD, these numbers are likely to escalate. However, do these medications
      alter UAW collapsibility and predispose to OSA in some individuals, as the investigators'
      preliminary observations suggest? This research is innovative because it will directly
      evaluate the effects of ICS on the UAW structure and function during sleep and wakefulness.
      At the study completion, it is the investigators expectation that they will have elucidated
      the effects and governing mechanisms of ICS on UAW patency and SDB severity. Data generated
      will form the foundation for future research aimed at expanding the investigators'
      understanding of ICS's effects on UAW and means to mitigate/prevent them. The clinical
      implication of these findings will be experimental-based verification of deleterious effects
      of ICS on UAW and risk for OSA, which will ultimately be of enormous financial benefit to the
      VA and OLD management programs.

      This trial is an innovative learning healthcare system approach to translate the concept of
      measurement-based depression care into a specialty clinic setting and extend the concept to
      treat depression and/or anxiety. The neurologist/APP-administered medication intervention
      utilizes FDA-approved drugs with advantageous features for use in epilepsy (escitalopram and
      venlafaxine) and a telephone-based chronic care management plan for repeated symptom
      measurement and side effect surveillance. The proposed intervention may overcome barriers to
      implementing mental health treatment interventions in generalized clinical settings by using
      healthcare providers commonly present in specialty clinics (physicians and APPs) along with a
      billable, best practices chronic care management intervention package. To test this idea, the
      study team seeks to pilot a feasibility trial of an epileptologist-driven medication
      treatment intervention for anxiety and depression, carried out directly in the epilepsy
      clinic during a regularly scheduled visit and supported by advanced practice provider (APP),

      Many patients who already harbor drug-resistant HIV require interruption of HAART due to poor
      compliance, poor quality of life, toxicity or development of resistance. In these patients
      interruption of HAART has a negative impact on patient immune status due to the reemergence
      of wild-type virus which is in general more pathogenic than HIV isolates containing
      resistance mutations. There is a need for ""bridging"" antiretroviral regimens that might
      prolong time off conventional HAART whilst waiting for a new regimen that is either fully
      suppressive or less toxic or less demanding for the patient.
    ",GMB: Study of Truvada (TDF+FTC) or Emtricitabine (FTC) Alone Versus HAART Interruption in HIV-Infected Patients With Resistance,HIV Infections,HIV Infections,"
      Virological failure associated with the appearance of resistant mutations is still common in
      patients receiving HAART. When HAART fails patients and clinicians can chose from three
      different courses of action:

        1. Switch therapy to a new salvage regimen based on the results of resistance testing.

           Success of the new salvage regimen is maximized if the new regimen includes
           antiretroviral drugs without cross-resistance with previous failed drugs or,
           preferably,new classes of drugs. In general, rescue regimens are more complicated for
           patients due to its higher pill burden; more frequent dosing and sometimes need for
           parenteral therapy (Enfuvirtide).

        2. Stop therapy. This strategy is feasible in patient with relatively preserved immune
           function. Time off antiretroviral therapy would be highly dependent on previous nadir
           CD4 cell count (the lowest the nadir, the more rapidly patients loses CD4 cells). In
           patients with multidrug resistant virus this strategy is used with the goal of achieving
           virus reversion towards wild-type forms. Reversion towards wild-type virus would
           theoretically ""resensitize"" HIV to prior failed drugs. Unfortunately, a number of
           investigations have suggested that the loss of CD4 cell count occurred during the time
           off therapy might not be regained after starting rescue therapy. In addition, reversion
           towards wild type virus does not appear to be associated with a more favourable outcome
           of rescue therapy.

        3. Maintain failing therapy. This strategy has the potential advantage of decreasing the
           rate of CD4 cell loss. It is known that certain mutations of HIV decrease viral fitness
           and produce a less pathogenic virus. Consequently, compared to wild-type virus, CD4
           destruction is decreased in the presence of resistance mutations. The very important
           risk inherent to this strategy is the accumulation of new antiretroviral mutations if
           the regimen is maintained. Due to cross-resistance among antiretroviral drugs,
           accumulation of new mutations decreases the chances of success of a new salvage regimen.

      Choosing among these three different strategies depends on a number of important factors.

        1. Availability of antiretroviral drugs active against resistant HIV isolates. Clinicians
           would be more prone to switch to a new salvage regimen if the new regimen contains a new
           class of drugs and/or at least three drugs without cross resistance with the
           antiretroviral included in the failing regimen. This scenario is very likely after first
           or second regimen failure. However, after third regimen failure the possibilities of
           including at least three active drugs dramatically decrease. For deep salvage the
           possibilities of constructing a viable rescue regimen often depends on enrolling the
           patient in a clinical trial of a new antiretroviral (for example CCR5 inhibitors).
           Enrolment in the trial very often implies that patients have to wait for an undefined
           period of time until the trial starts.

        2. Willingness of patient to switch to a more complicated regimen. After second regimen
           failure, rescue therapies involve a higher pill burden, more frequent dosing and, in a
           substantial number of cases, the need of parenteral therapy with enfuvirtide. In this
           situation it is possible that the patient prefer not to start the new therapy due to the
           negative impact of the new regimen in his quality of life.

        3. Immune status of the patient. In patients with low CD4 cell count stopping therapy can
           put the patient at risk of developing an opportunistic disease. In general patients and
           clinicians are reluctant to stop therapy if the current CD4 cell count is below 200-250
           cells/mL.

      Apart from the setting of virological failure HAART interruption might be needed in patients
      with well controlled viral replication (HIV viremia persistently below 50 copies/ mL).
      Possible reasons for HAART interruption in this scenario are:

        1. Toxicity of current regimen.

        2. Patient desire (for example travel abroad).

        3. Poor quality of life related to treatment issues.

        4. Poor adherence to current HAART regimen and an impending risk of developing resistance
           mutations. When a patient stop HAART due to these reasons, wild-type HIV re-emerges with
           the consequent loss of CD4 cells. Depending on the immune status of the patient and
           prior CD4 cell nadir time off therapy might be quite limited.

      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is one of the leading causes of
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the severity of this disease, no established treatments
      exist for this class of PH. Nebivolol is a drug used in high blood pressure and heart
      failure, but not used in patients with PH. Due to some additional properties it possesses,
      the investigators believe nebivolol will improve disease severity in patients with PH

      This mixed-methods study follows a prospective cohort of participants receiving Mifeprex®

      participating in this study will be assessed by a clinician and provided Mifeprex® and
      misoprostol in a clinical setting. To assess acceptability of this service delivery model
      among participants, and feasibility of implementing a larger randomized controlled trial, the
      study will survey participants, evaluate any clinical outcomes recorded during clinical
      visits, and interview participants about their experiences participating in the study.
    ",Advance Provision of Medication Abortion,Early Abortion,,"
      The overarching goal of the project is to improve access to early abortion by reducing
      barriers that patients face obtaining services. Currently, patients are prescribed and
      receive Mifeprex® and misoprostol directly from a clinician, who evaluates patients for
      medical eligibility and contraindications. The Mifeprex® may be taken in the facility or at
      home, and the misoprostol is taken 24-48 hours later at home. The FDA recommends a follow-up
      visit, which can be over the phone.

      The purpose of this study is to pilot test the model of advance provision of medication
      abortion (MAB). In this model, patients at risk of unintended pregnancy and with a desire to
      avoid pregnancy will be assessed by a clinician and provided counseling on pregnancy
      recognition and testing, as well as how to administer MAB at home. For this pilot study, only
      patients who have previously had a MAB will be included, since this population has reported
      the highest interest in the model, and they are also already familiar with how to use the
      medications. The clinician will provide Mifeprex® and misoprostol to the patient at the time
      of counseling in case the patient becomes pregnant and wants to terminate the pregnancy using
      the medications up to 10 weeks gestation. Patients will contact a study clinician for an
      over-the-phone assessment of eligibility for MAB, including assessment of gestational age,
      before self-administration of Mifeprex® and misoprostol, and then attend a follow-up visit
      with the clinician.

      Patients will sign the Danco Patient Agreement Form prior to receiving the medication.
      Clinicians dispensing the medications will have signed the Prescriber Agreement Form, and the
      medications will be dispensed in a clinic or hospital. Study investigators will monitor
      participant activity through surveys throughout the study. Participants will be given clear
      instructions on study participation and returning unused medications in an appropriate time
      frame. Clinicians will also re-evaluate participants by telephone before they take the
      medications and evaluate them in person at a subsequent follow-up visit.

      Background: In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin, two main
      therapeutic options are equally plausible: add-on a sulfonylurea (SU) or a thiazolidinedione
      (TZD). Since the two classes of drugs clearly differ in terms of mechanisms of action, side
      effects, economic costs and cardiovascular risk factors profile, a direct comparison of the
      two therapeutic strategies would be most appropriate.

      Aims: 1) To evaluate the effects of add-on pioglitazone as compared with add-on a SU on the
      incidence of cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with
      metformin; 2) To compare the two treatments in terms of glycemic control, safety, and
      economic costs.

      Methods: multicentre, randomised, open label, parallel group trial of 48 months duration.
      Eligible participants (type 2 diabetic males and females, aged 50-75 years, BMI 20-45 Kg/m2,
      in treatment for the last two months with metformin 2 gr/die in monotherapy and with HbA1c >
      =7.0% and <= 9.0%) will be randomized to add-on: a SU - glibenclamide (5-15 mg/die),
      gliclazide (30-120 mg/die), glimepiride (2-6 mg/die), chosen according to local practice - or
      pioglitazone (15-45 mg/die). A HbA1c value > 8.0 % on two consecutive occasions will lead to
      addition of insulin to ongoing oral therapy.

      Primary efficacy outcome: a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non fatal MI
      (including silent MI), non fatal stroke, and unplanned coronary revascularization.

      Secondary outcomes. Principal secondary outcome: a composite ischemic endpoint of sudden
      death, fatal and non fatal acute MI (including silent MI), fatal and non fatal stroke, major
      amputations (above ankle), endovascular or surgical intervention on the coronary, leg or
      carotid arteries.

      Other secondary outcomes

      - a composite cardiovascular end point including the primary end point plus hospitalization
      for heart failure, endovascular or surgical intervention on the coronary, leg or carotid
      arteries, silent MI, angina - by WHO criteria and confirmed by a new electrocardiogram
      abnormality - intermittent claudication with an ankle/brachial index lower than 090; events
      of heart failure; a microvascular endpoint including: plasma creatinine increase of 2 times
      above the baseline value or creatinine clearance reduction of 20ml/min/1. 73m2 or development
      of overt nephropathy (dialysis or plasma creatinine >3,3 mg/dl) or macroalbuminuria; glycemic
      control (changes from baseline in HBA1c, time to failure of glycemic control, i.e., HBA1c
      >8.0% on two consecutive occasions three months apart); major CV risk factors (lipids, blood
      pressure, microalbuminuria, inflammation markers, waist circumference); safety and side
      effects; direct and indirect costs.

      Data regarding CV endpoints, safety, tolerability, and study conduct will be monitored and
      analyzed by an independent committee, and will be not available to the study investigators
      until the closing of data collection. Efficacy end points will be analyzed on an
      intention-to-treat basis.

      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among
      diabetic patients.The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)clearly showed that tight glycemic
      control significantly decreases diabetes-related events. Therefore, achievement of HbA1c < 7%
      is a major goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes since this parameter still represents the
      best predictor of micro and macrovascular complications. However, it is often difficult to
      maintain this goal because of the progressive deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function
      and insulin sensitivity. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes generally requires a
      stepwise therapeutic approach starting with lifestyle intervention (diet and increased
      physical activity). After lifestyle changes have failed, drug therapy is initiated and
      progressively intensified through the combination of different classes of hypoglycemic
      agents. Since insulin resistance is recognized as a major factor in the pathogenesis of type
      2 diabetes and associated CV risk factors, drugs that improve insulin sensitivity are advised
      as initial pharmacological therapy. Currently, metformin is recommended as the first-line
      drug for patients with type 2 diabetes. Great uncertainty exists regarding the best
      therapeutic option in diabetic patients inadequately controlled with metformin, due to the
      lack of randomized controlled trials that have directly compared the efficacy of different
      combination regimens in achieving glycemic goals. The paucity of sound clinical evidence in
      this area is highlighted in a Consensus Statement from the American Diabetes Association and
      the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, that suggested either a sulphonylurea
      (SU) or a thiazolidinediones (TZD) as additional medication to metformin, in the absence of
      data demonstrating the superiority of one combination over the other. Addition of a SU or a
      TZD to concomitant metformin results in a substantial improvement in glucose control with a
      mean reduction in HbA1c of 1-1.5%. However, a direct evaluation of these treatment
      strategies, within a large clinical trial, would be most appropriate, given their different
      mechanisms of action, side effects and costs. Indeed, the only direct comparison between a SU
      and a TZD added to metformin has been obtained in a short-term study (24 weeks), which showed
      a greater reduction in HbA1c with the association metformin-glibenclamide (- 1.5%) compared
      with the association metformin-rosiglitazone (-1.1%, <0.001). More patients receiving
      metformin-glibenclamide reached HbA1c <7.0 % than did those receiving metformin-rosiglitazone
      (60% vs. 47%). In addition, a more favorable lipid profile was present in patients treated
      with metformin-glibenclamide, although this finding has not been confirmed in other studies.
      However, the short duration of the study precluded evaluation of CV endpoints.

      This lack of information prevents an evidence-based choice between these two treatment
      options.

      In this respect, several studies are underway to investigate the potential of different
      glucose-lowering therapies on CV outcomes. With regard to SU, retrospective cohort studies
      have documented a higher risk of adverse outcomes in patients treated with a SU in
      monotherapy or in combination with metformin as compared to metformin alone. In the UKPDS,
      diabetic patients treated with a combination of glibenclamide plus metformin showed an
      increase in CV mortality compared with other groups of treatment. However, these data derive
      from a post-hoc analysis and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution. In contrast, the
      ADOPT study has shown a lower proportion of CV events in the glibenclamide group compared
      with rosiglitazone and metformin. These conflicting reports underline the need to evaluate
      the rate of CV events induced by the combination metformin-SU in comparison with other
      treatment strategies. Regarding TZDs, a recent prospective study (PROACTIVE Study) has
      compared the efficacy of adding pioglitazone (from 15 to 45 mg/die) or placebo to the
      standard hypoglycemia therapy in the secondary prevention of CV events in type 2 diabetic
      patients. Pioglitazone treatment did not significantly affect the primary endpoint, which
      included all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or
      surgical intervention in the coronary or leg arteries and leg amputation, but significantly
      reduced the number of patients who experienced the secondary endpoint (all-cause mortality,
      nonfatal MI and stroke). However, patients treated with pioglitazone had 115 more episodes of
      heart failure than the placebo group. In addition, weight gain was 4 kg greater with
      pioglitazone than with placebo, and much greater than that expected on the basis of the
      improved glycemic control. These conflicting reports support the need for large-scale
      clinical trials that compare the efficacy of the association of metformin plus a SU vs.
      metformin plus a TZD on CV outcomes. For these reasons, the Italian Diabetes Society has
      organized a randomized controlled clinical trial on long term cardiovascular effects of these
      two therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study is to ascertain whether in patients with
      type 2 diabetes poorly controlled with metformin in monotherapy, the addition of pioglitazone
      reduces the rate of cardiovascular events as compared with the addition of a SU. Glucose
      control, major CV risk factors, safety, tolerability and economic costs with the two
      therapeutic regimens will also be compared.

      Design: multicentre, randomized, open-label, comparative, parallel-group trial of 48 months
      duration (PROBE: Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point).

      RECRUITMENT WAS TERMINATED IN JANUARY 20147, WITH 3040 PATIENTS ENROLLED. Screening and
      follow-up took place at several Clinical Units which will work in collaboration with a
      network of Diabetes Outpatients Clinics all over Italy. All study procedures will be
      performed by trained study personnel according to a standardized protocol.

      All eligible patients meeting the inclusion criteria, free from any condition listed in the
      exclusion criteria and giving the informed consent, have been randomized to one of two arms:

        -  Metformin (2 gr/die) + sulfonylurea

        -  Metformin (2 gr/die) + pioglitazone In the group randomized to metformin plus a
           sulfonylurea the choice between glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride will be left
           to the study physician following local practices.

      Participating centres were masked to the randomization sequences which were generated at the
      Epidemiology Unit of the ""Consorzio Mario Negri Sud"" (Dr Nicolucci). Patients entering the
      trial were allocated to the treatment group upon a telephone call from the clinic to the
      Epidemiology Unit after verification of all eligibility/exclusion criteria. The randomization
      sequences were stratified by clinic, gender and previous cardiovascular events.

      Patients are seen for clinical follow up after 1, 3 and 6 months from the randomization and
      then every 6 months unless clinical conditions requiring more frequent medical consultations
      develop (according to GCP). Telephonic contacts are established with all patients in order to
      take information on adverse events,on glycaemic control and to modify drugs dosage.

      The metformin dose will remain constant throughout the study; the initial dose of added drug
      will be 5 mg glibenclamide or 30 mg gliclazide or 2 mg glimepiride for the group randomized
      to metformin plus SU and 15 mg pioglitazone in the group randomized to metformin plus
      pioglitazone. If glucose control is unsatisfactory (fasting glucose >120mg/dl or post
      prandial glucose >160 mg/dl in more than 50% of home readings over a 8 weeks period), study
      medications will be uptitrated to the maximal effective daily dose (i.e. 15 mg glibenclamide,
      120 mg gliclazide, 6 mg glimepiride, 45 mg pioglitazone). If a HbA1c >8.0% is observed at any
      follow up visit, patients will receive reinforcement of lifestyle education, compliance to
      study protocol will be assessed and a glycated hemoglobin measurement will be repeated after
      three months. A confirmed value >8.0% despite adherence to maximal doses of study medications
      for the previous three months, will lead to addiction of a single injection of insulin
      Glargine bed-time. Insulin titration will be performed on the basis of fasting capillary
      glycemia according to a pre-defined algorithm. If a HbA1c >8.0% is observed at two
      consecutive follow-up visits 3 months apart, one or more injections of analog insulin will be
      added. Insulin will be titrated down, according to a pre-specified algorithm, if frequent
      hypoglycemic episodes occur.

      Use of concomitant medications (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and antiplatelet agents)
      will be permitted throughout the study, according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

      Patients will stop the study medications but will remain in the study if any of the following
      conditions develops:

        -  alanine aminotransferase increases 2.5 or more times above baseline on two consecutive
           occasions (one month apart)

        -  signs and symptoms suggestive of heart failure evaluated according to the American Heart
           Association and the American Diabetes Association consensus on glitazones and heart
           failure (19).

        -  bladder cancer (in that case the study drug will be stopped only in the pioglitazone
           arm)

        -  medical conditions contraindicating oral hypoglycemic treatment and requiring stable
           insulin treatment.

      The sample size is calculated based on the assumption that the study results would be
      relevant for the public health point of view in case add-on treatment with pioglitazone
      proves more effective than add-on sulfonylureas for the management of hyperglycemia and the
      prevention of the chronic complications of diabetes.

      The sample size is thus estimated to detect with a 80% power of reduction in the risk of
      events of 20% (HR=0.80; metformin + Pioglitazone vs metformin + SU), with p<0.05 (one sided
      log rank test). Assuming an estimated occurrence rate of the primary end point of 3.5% per
      annum (24-26) and a 5% loss at follow-up, a total of 3371 patients will be enrolled with the
      event driven analysis at 498 end point events.

      A Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) composed of Cardiologists and Specialists in Internal
      Medicine with vascular expertise will review and adjudicate all potential end points,
      according to pre-specified criteria. This committee will be blind to the study medication
      assignment group and independent of the Steering Committee. Side effects (i.e. weight gain,
      peripheral edema, hypoglycemic episodes, etc.) will be monitored. All adverse events, whether
      or not attributed to study drugs, will be collected and recorded on the appropriate, ad hoc
      page(s) of the Case Report Form (CRF). The Data Safety Monitoring Board, composed of clinical
      trials expertise, will monitor events and side effects and will decide the study
      discontinuation in the case of a significant difference between the two arms in the rate of
      the primary endpoint or serious adverse events.

      At baseline and at each follow-up visit (ever six months) the following parameters will be
      assessed:

        -  vital signs, anthropometry, check for any new signs/symptoms

        -  home glucose readings

        -  frequency of hypoglycemic episodes graded by severity.

        -  intercurrent illnesses/events, change(s) in use or dose of drugs

        -  history of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, major leg amputation
           (above ankle), acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, endovascular or surgical
           intervention on the coronary, leg or carotid arteries)

        -  angina or intermittent claudication At baseline and every months safety parameters (ALT,
           AST, macroematuria) and HbA1c will be evaluated.

      At baseline and every 12 months serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and
      triglycerides), microalbuminuria and C Reactive Protein (CRP) will be evaluated.

      At baseline and every 12 months a standard resting ECG (Minnesota coding) will be performed.

      All study investigations will be performed according to a standard protocol described in
      detail in the operating manual which will be produced by the Coordinating Center in
      collaboration with the Steering Committee. Prior to study start-up, the investigators will
      attend training and standardization sessions to reduce inter-observer variability; these
      sessions will be organized and supervised by the Coordinating Centre. Ad hoc CRFs will be
      developed to collect information which will be transmitted to the Epidemiology Unit.

      The CRFs will be reviewed and data queries will be produced to correct missing or incorrect
      data on the CRFs. Periodically a Quality Team (appointed by the Steering Committee) will
      check the amount of CRFs per centre and produce recalls for centres not sending CRFs. An
      electronic data base will be created using a standardized procedure of data input.

      The study conduct (i.e. timing, adherence to protocol etc..) at each participating centre
      will be monitored by regular visits of professional monitors (at the start-up, at the end of
      the study and twice a year). A Steering Committee will meet to review the study progress
      every 6 months, and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor
      safety outcomes throughout the course of the study. This Committee will assess at given
      intervals the safety data, the critical efficacy endpoints and will recommend whether to
      continue, modify, or stop the trial. Stringent statistical criteria will be set for early
      study termination in the event of a clear-cut difference between the treatment groups with
      respect to all-cause mortality. The DSMB should also recommend termination of the study for

      The researchers hypothesize that utilization of the Flexitouch system will improve the
      healing rates of (venous stasis ulcers) VSU compared to traditional compression wrapping
      therapy alone.

      Primary Objective: The primary study objective is to determine whether the complete healing
      rate of venous stasis ulcers at 12 weeks is improved by the addition of Flexitouch® System
      compression therapy to a standard regimen of compression wrapping.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine whether the addition of Flexitouch System compression therapy to a standard
           regimen of compression wrapping increases the percentage reduction in wound surface
           area.

        -  To determine whether the addition of Flexitouch compression therapy to a standard
           regimen of compression wrapping increases the percentage reduction in volume of the
           affected limb.

        -  To determine whether the addition of Flexitouch compression therapy to a standard
           regimen of compression wrapping decreases the time to healing of the venous stasis
           ulcer.

      Background:

      Overview of venous stasis ulcers (1-3): Venous stasis ulceration is a common complication of
      venous insufficiency in the United States. Venous stasis ulcers (VSU) are associated with
      very significant morbidity, including patient disability, moderate to severe pain, and
      frequent leg infections. There is also a large cost associated with the medical care needed
      for this condition and the inability of patients to work. In some patients, this condition
      can be life- or limb-threatening.

      Current standard of care for VSU: It is widely accepted that VSU should be treated by an
      individualized program of compression wrapping therapy (3-5). This therapy is designed to
      counteract the presumed pathophysiology of VSU, which develop as a result of valvular reflux
      and venous hypertension. However, the efficacy of compression therapy alone is suboptimal,
      with healing rates of roughly 34% reported after 12 weeks of therapy (6). Various adjunctive
      treatments have been studied, including artificial skin grafts (6-8). However, none of these
      adjunctive modalities have become widely accepted for the treatment of VSU.

      Potential role of compression pumps: Intermittent sequential compression pumps are widely
      used as an adjunctive modality in the treatment of VSU. These pumps use high compression and
      are expensive, but this expense may be outweighed by improved healing of VSU. The use of
      compression pumps is consistent with the pathophysiology of VSU, but data regarding the
      efficacy of such therapy is scarce. To date, no study has adequately assessed the efficacy of
      compression pump therapy in the treatment of VSU (9).

      Flexitouch System: The Flexitouch System was designed by a therapist trained in manual
      lymphatic drainage therapy and is produced by Tactile Systems Technology, Inc. The Flexitouch
      System was designed to simulate MLD techniques and is intended for home use during the
      self-management phase of CDT. MLD is one (of four) component(s) of Complete Decongestive
      Therapy, considered the ""Gold Standard"" for treatment of lymphedema. MLD is a gentle, manual
      technique producing very light directional pressure/stretch on the skin with manipulation of
      healthy lymph nodes and vessels. The effects of properly applied MLD include increased intake
      of lymphatic loads into the lymphatic system, increased lymphangiomotoricity, increased
      volume of transported lymph fluid, increased venous return in the superficial venous system,
      promotion of parasympathetic response and pain control. Treatment is always initiated at the
      trunk segments, with decongestion of proximal areas, prior to addressing the involved
      extremity (to clear central areas and promote decongestion of more distal areas). The
      extremity is then treated in segments, starting with the proximal segments and then
      progressing from distal to proximal regions. The Flexitouch® System is not intended to
      replace the intensive phase of CDT. However, it follows the principles of MLD in many ways.
      Flexitouch system provides limb treatment, but in addition, it addresses trunk congestion.
      The lower extremity garment set consists of two garments, one garment fits over the affected
      lower extremity and the other fits over the lower abdomen/trunk. Each garment is made up of
      multiple inflatable chambers within a flexible, stretchable fabric. The treatment consists of
      a 2-phase program. As in MLD, the preparation phase begins the treatment starting at the
      inguinal quadrant. Each curved trunk chamber inflates and deflates sequentially to facilitate
      the movement of edema fluid into the systemic circulation. The cycle is repeated several
      times. The inflation/deflation cycle is then repeated in each limb region from the knee to
      the groin, from the ankle to the knee, and finally from the toes to the ankle. The second
      phase, drainage, begins the sequential inflation/deflation cycle at the toes and continues
      moving up the leg to the quadrant of the trunk to facilitate the movement of edema fluid from
      the inguinal quadrant into the system circulation.

      Choice of compression pump device for study of VSU treatment: A variety of inflatable
      compression pumps are available, but there are no data to help choose among these devices
      (9). No compression device is accepted as a standard of care for VSU. Flexitouch system
      differs from standard (intermittent sequential) compression pumps in significant ways. As
      described above, Flexitouch system is unique as a compression device, because it provides not
      only sequential limb compression, but also trunk compression. Flexitouch system's two-phase
      program (preparation and drainage) also makes it different from other compression devices.
      The fact that the system was created for lymphedema may be an advantage in the treatment of
      VSU, because many authors (10;11) believe that secondary lymphedema plays an important role
      among VSU patients.

      Study Outline:

      Patient enrollment procedure

        -  An approved consent form and authorization permitting release of personal health
           information must be signed by the patient or guardian.

        -  All eligibility requirements indicated in Section 3.0 must be satisfied.

        -  The patient must be registered by calling the study coordinator Lisa Rudman, at
           Allegheny General Hospital (412-359-4325).

      General treatment plan: After enrollment, all patients will be seen once per week for a
      12-week period for standard compression wrapping. At each visit, treatment and assessment
      will be undertaken as described below. The Flexitouch group only will use the Flexitouch
      System both at home (once daily) and in-clinic (once per week).

      Essential elements of treatment and assessment:

      Applicable to ALL patients

        -  The patients will be seen at the wound center one(1) times per week for 12 weeks.

        -  Patients will receive compression wrapping as standard of care therapy. The precise
           amount of compression will be individualized according to patient tolerance using 3M
           Coban 2 layer Compression System.

        -  The wound area will be measured and photographed weekly, using wound tracing and
           planimetry software.

        -  The limb volume will be measured weekly, using available software (NetHealth, Pittsburgh
           PA).

        -  The presence or absence of wound infection will be assessed. The need for wound
           debridement will be recorded.

        -  The wound will be scored as to whether or not it has healed. If the wound healed at a
           previous visit, the presence of recurrent ulceration will be assessed.

        -  The occurrence of treatment failure will be recorded (see section 7d).

        -  Comprehensive standard wound care treatment including gentle wound cleansing with saline
           solution at each visit, maintaining moisture balance in the wound and periwound with
           appropriate dressings (alginate, foam, hydrogel or hydrocolloid), reminding subjects of
           the importance of proper nutrition, leg elevation at rest and activity, including
           frequent ambulation and ankle ROM exercises through the day.

      Additional steps applicable to patients randomized to Flexitouch arm:

        -  Patients will be provided a home Flexitouch unit. They will be given instructions to use
           the Flexitouch system on a once daily basis. They will not need remove the compression
           wrap for the home therapy.

        -  In addition to the home use, at each clinic visit, the patient's trunk and affected limb
           will be treated for 60 minutes with the Flexitouch system.

        -  The patient will be asked to indicate their level of comfort with the in-clinic
           Flexitouch session (scale of 0 to 5; 0 = very comfortable, 5 = very uncomfortable).

      Patients who are admitted to subacute rehabilitation facilities following hospitalization are
      frequently anemic. The purpose of this study is to see if anemic patients treated with
      epoetin alfa will have higher hemoglobin levels and better functional recovery at 3, 8, and
      12 weeks after study entry compared to patients who do not receive epoetin alfa.

      Anemia is associated with loss of function in some studies. However, it is unknown if more
      rapid correction of anemia in patients who enter a rehabilitation setting after surgery or
      from hospitalization for acute medical problems leads to shorter rehabilitation stays and
      improved functional status.

      Patients aged 60 and older who have hemoglobin levels of less than 10.5 g/dL will be
      randomized to receive 8 weekly doses of either erythropoietin alfa or placebo. Functional
      status will be measured at baseline and then at 3, 8 and 12 weeks.

      The following specific aims will be tested in this study:

        -  Determine the prevalence of anemia in patients admitted to a subacute rehabilitation
           facility with potential for recovery.

        -  Determine the baseline functional status of patients admitted to a subacute
           rehabilitation facility with potential for recovery using the Functional Independence
           Measure (FIM), an assessment tool used in acute rehabilitation settings.

      Collectively, evidence shows that a combination of medication and behavioral therapy is most
      effective for migraine care. The ED is a critical point of contact with the health care
      system for many migraine patients; in current practice, it is a missed opportunity to
      initiate and establish a comprehensive migraine management paradigm. Behavioral headache
      treatments (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT)) are effective migraine treatment options that are essentially free of side
      effects. PMR has also been successful as a technique that patients can do independently.
      Studies have shown that combination pharmacological-behavioral therapy is most effective for
      migraine treatment.

      Several aspects of this study are innovative, including: 1. Initiation of preventive
      medication in a timely manner for migraineurs who present to the ED. 2. Introduction of
      PM+PMR in the ED at a time that can serve as a teachable moment. 3. Introduction of a
      smartphone application-based product (a minimal contact based behavioral therapy) in the ED
      setting to reduce headache disability, frequency, and intensity.

      After obtaining written informed consent, all patients will be sedated with 1-5 mg midazolam
      and up to 100 mcg fentanyl before any procedure is performed. They will be attached to
      standard ASA monitors and their vital signs recorded before sedation and every 5 minutes
      throughout the procedure. They will receive supplemental oxygen 2-4 LPM with a nasal canula.
      They will be given 1 g acetaminophen orally with a sip of water before sedation.

      The randomization envelope will be opened and the patient will be randomized to one of the
      two groups.

      All patients will receive a femoral nerve block after identification of the landmarks or with
      ultrasound guidance and a femoral catheter will be inserted perineurally. The patients will
      be placed supine position for the procedure. The femoral artery will be identified either by
      ultrasound or a hand held Doppler. A point 1 cm lateral to the femoral artery and 1 cm below
      the inguinal crease is marked. A 5 cm Tuohy needle (Pajunk Medical) will be inserted at a 45°
      angle at 1.5 mA and 1 Hz. Once a brisk quadriceps twitch is identified, the needle will be
      positioned accurately so as to establish quadriceps stimulation at ≤ 0.5 mA.

      The peripheral nerve catheter will be inserted through the needle. Once the catheter is
      positioned satisfactorily in the perineural area, it will be tunneled subcutaneously and a
      sterile dressing will be applied to cover the catheter completely. Ropivacaine (30 mL of
      0.5%) will be injected through the catheter after frequent aspirations. The block will be
      assessed by sensory and motor assessments at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes. Sensory testing will
      be performed on the anterior aspect of the knee (femoral nerve), medial aspect of the knee
      (obturator nerve) and the lateral aspect of the thigh (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve). The
      block will be considered complete when no cold discrimination was observed (Score 2), partial
      when cold discrimination was decreased (score 1), and absent when normal cold discrimination
      was observed (Score 0). Femoral motor block will also be assessed during the same period by
      testing knee extension, and will be considered complete when no extension is observed,
      partial when quadriceps motor force is decreased and absent when normal quadriceps function
      is observed. Patients with complete sensory block of the femoral and obturator nerves after
      15 minutes will be included in the study.

      Group I: Peripheral Nerve group: This group will have a sciatic catheter placed either before
      or after surgery. They will receive a sciatic catheter by subgluteal approach with the use of
      ultrasound. The ischial tuberosity will be identified with the ultrasound probe and its
      midpoint marked. A point 3 cm lateral and 4 cm caudad will be marked. Patients will be placed
      in the lateral position. A 18 G Tuohy needle will be inserted at a 45° angle until a peroneal
      or tibial twitch is obtained at 1.5 mA. Once the current can be reduced to obtain a twitch
      less than 0.5 mA, a catheter will be inserted and placed perineurally. If placed
      preoperatively, the catheter will be flushed with normal saline or 5% dextrose and will not
      be dosed until after surgery. After the patient is in the PACU and the surgeons have verified
      the sciatic nerve function, the sciatic catheter will be dosed with 35 mL 0.25% ropivacaine.

      Group II: Depodur Group: Preoperatively this group of patients will have an L2-L3 epidural
      placed while they are in the sitting position before or after femoral catheter placement.
      They will receive 7.5 mg Depodur via the epidural catheter. All of these patients will
      receive Singular 10 mg and Claritin 10 mg before the epidural Depodur is placed, as per our
      protocol of patients receiving EREM.

      All patients will receive general anesthesia with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and
      propofol, as needed, for induction of anesthesia. The patients will be paralyzed with
      succinylcholine, rocuronium, or any other non-depolarizing muscle relaxant of choice of
      anesthesiologist. Analgesia will be maintained at the discretion of the anesthesiologist
      overseeing the case. Anesthesia will be maintained with a volatile anesthetic and oxygen or
      TIVA to maintain BIS between 40 and 50. Vital signs will be recorded every 15 minutes. They
      will also receive dexamethasone 4 mg, metoclopramide 20 mg IV at induction and ondansetron 4
      mg after induction, if they have more than 40% risk of PONV as per their Apfel score.

      Patients will be extubated at the end of the case and transferred to PACU. If patients
      complain of pain, they will receive fentanyl 25-50-mcg increments as per the discretion of
      PACU nurse to achieve a VRS < 4. Patients may be prescribed a morphine PCA (1 mg morphine
      with a 6-minute lockout) for postoperative pain relief in the PACU once their pain is stable
      at VRS<4.

      All patients will be prescribed acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 hours for 3 days after surgery.
      They will be prescribed metoclopramide 20 mg IV PRN every 6 hours as rescue medication for
      nausea and/or vomiting for 2 days postoperatively. Patients still nauseous will get
      Promethazine (Phenergan) 6.25-12.5 mg as second line rescue.

      Post-procedure myalgia (muscle ache) is a well-known and common complication of
      Electro-convulsive Treatment (ECT). Myalgias are a serious concern of patients and occur in
      approximately 50% of these cases. The pain is usually described as muscle soreness, similar
      to that resulting from strenuous exercise. The myalgias typically begin shortly after the
      procedure, lasting approximately 2-7 days in total. A recent study reported that 89% of
      patients considered prevention significant and would be willing to pay a median of $33 out of
      pocket to avoid this side effect. In addition to patient discomfort, myalgias can have a
      further financial burden if these patients are unable to return to work or resume previous
      daily activities in the days following the procedure. An agent that could treat and possibly
      even prevent these myalgias has the potential to be very beneficial to these patients. IV
      ibuprofen (trade name Caldolor) is a novel therapeutic modality approved by the US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2009 for the treatment of mild to moderate pain, as an

      IV ibuprofen (trade name Caldolor) is a novel therapeutic modality approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2009 for the treatment of mild to moderate pain, as an
      adjunct to opioid analgesics, and for the reduction of fever. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which produces its effect through inhibition of the enzyme
      cyclooxygenase (COX). There are at least 2 variations of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) and
      ibuprofen non-selectively inhibits both, thus decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. This action
      gives ibuprofen its analgesic, anti-pyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. NSAIDs have an
      established history of efficacy in the treatment of both acute and chronic somatic pain.
      Caldolor, being an intravenous formulation, offers a distinct advantage in patients who
      either are unable to take medications orally or are fasting preoperatively.

      Post-procedure myalgia is a well-known and common complication of ECT. Although the exact
      etiology is unknown, the myalgias are believed to result from a combination of
      succinylcholine administration and the seizure activity induced by the ECT procedure itself.
      Succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgias are a well-known phenomenon, initially
      described in the early 1950's. The exact pathogenesis is unknown, with muscle damage from
      succinylcholine-induced fasciculations or calcium-mediated phospholipase A2 activation and
      prostaglandin production being proposed as possible etiologies. The latter mechanism provides
      the rationale for using NSAID therapy. However, succinylcholine is unlikely to be the only
      factor involved in the development of myalgias following ECT, as a recent study showed that
      dose adjustments to succinylcholine did not affect rates of myalgia in these patients.
      Furthermore, seizures can also cause direct muscle injury and there have been reports of
      muscle pain after ECT both with and without succinylcholine.

      A thorough literature search using Medline, Ovid, and scholar.google failed to find any
      research articles evaluating pretreatment therapy for myalgias in post-ECT patients. The
      current practice for the treatment of myalgias following ECT has been extrapolated from
      research on succinylcholine-induced myalgia in post-surgical patients. Previous studies have
      shown at least partial efficacy with pretreatment of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking
      agents, benzodiazepines, sodium channel blockers (predominantly lidocaine), and nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. The nature of the ECT procedure itself makes several of these
      modalities undesirable. Both Lidocaine and benzodiazepines can alter the seizure threshold
      and the short duration of the procedure possibly increases the risks associated with longer
      acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (ie. blurred vision, diplopia, difficulty breathing
      and swallowing). Therefore, the options for pretreatment are limited. In addition, a recent
      meta-analysis of randomized trials determined NSAIDs to cumulatively have the best efficacy
      of any pretreatment therapy in the prevention of post-procedural myalgias. Due to its
      intravenous formulation, some practitioners have administered ketorolac to ECT patients
      before the procedure. However, despite a proven efficacy in myalgia prevention shown by
      NSAIDs as a class, a study specifically examining the use of ketorolac in this regard failed
      to show any benefit. The use of Ibuprofen has yet to be examined.

      Experimental Plan:

      The study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. The subject population will consist of patients undergoing first time
      electroconvulsive therapy, ranging in age from 18 to 80 years. Subjects will be given a
      Mini-Mental State Examination at the time of their presentation for ECT to assess their
      cognitive ability. If the patient consents and fits the inclusion criteria, patients will be
      randomized to one treatment modality, which they will receive for the first three treatment
      sessions. The subject and the person collecting the data will both be blinded as to what
      treatment modality the subject belongs to. The patients will be divided into two groups,
      Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 will be treated with IV ibuprofen 800mg/8ml given over 30
      minutes, prior to induction for ECT; while Group 2 will receive an identically appearing
      placebo dose, also administered IV, over that same time period. Both groups will receive a
      standardized anesthetic consisting of methohexital at 1 mg/kg IV for induction and
      succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV for muscle paralysis. Other medications (eg. anticholinergic or
      antihypertensive drugs) will be administered at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. ECT
      will be administered by the psychiatrist in order to achieve a seizure with a motor component
      of > 15 second duration. Patients will be transported to the recovery room for
      post-anesthesia care. Rescue analgesics (Tylenol 500mg PO, Tylenol with codeine 300/30mg PO,
      Fentanyl 25 mcg IV) will be available to any patient with complaints of myalgia or headache
      pain of VAS >4.

      Measurement Tools:

      Severity of myalgias will be assessed based on a self-reported assessment utilizing a
      numerical rating scale (NRS). The scale will be rated as 0 meaning no pain at all and 10
      meaning that pain is so severe as to interfere with daily activities.

      Questionnaire:

      Do you have any muscle aches or pain right now? If yes, how would you rate that muscle
      ache/pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being pain that is the worst
      imaginable?

      2.0 Description of knowledge relating to the condition in question

      Acute pyelonephritis (AP) is the most common proven bacterial infection in pediatric clinical
      practice. It can lead to sepsis or renal abscess and induce long-term complications such as
      renal scarring. Renal scarring during childhood can lead to hypertension or chronic renal
      disease at adult age, although the link between AP and chronic renal disease has not been
      firmly established.

      AP is most frequently due to Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli. Extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) now account for 5% of AP in France and
      represent a serious threat to public health, owing to limited therapeutic options.

      The overall clinical success rate in children treated for AP is around 95% and is not
      significantly different when ESBL-E are implicated. In children with no prior urological
      malformation, recurrence in the following 3 months occurs in less than 5% of cases.
      Antibiotic treatment decreases the risk of renal scarring, which remains important, around
      15% (95% CI: 11-18) in the largest meta-analysis. Moreover, delay in treatment of AP is
      associated with permanent renal scarring.

      In children without prior urological malformation, acute complications are exceptional, even
      in the presence of bacteraemia. Short courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics (2-4 days)
      followed by oral therapy have proved to be as efficient as longer courses (7-14 days) of IV
      treatment. For children aged ≥ 1 month, oral treatment alone for 10 to 14 days has proved non
      inferior to initial IV antibiotics (2-4 days) followed by oral therapy (total 10 to 14 days).

      French Paediatric guidelines recommend a short course (up to 4 days) of IV amikacin and/or
      ceftriaxone followed by oral therapy (total 10 days), with the possibility, for children aged
      > 3 months of a 10-day course of oral cefixime [12]. In children initially treated IV, the
      oral relay occurs once the urine culture and antibiogram are available. The American
      Association of Pediatrics that focused on children aged 2 to 24 months recommends either an
      oral or a sequential IV/oral treatment for a total of 7 to 14 days, while the British NICE
      guidelines recommend an exclusively oral route only for children aged ≥ 3 months

      In practice, most centers initiate an IV treatment in a large subset of patients (ongoing
      practice analysis on the management of AP in children in France, personal data, to be
      published in 2021). An initial IV treatment is particularly used in young children, with an
      age cut-off varying between 3 months and 3 years according to the center. It is also used to
      secure the absorption of the treatment if the child vomits, is unable to take oral
      antibiotics or is severely unwell.

      The excellent short-term and the good long-term clinical outcomes in children treated for AP
      questions the need for a 10-day course of antibiotics.

      In adults, shorter treatments, such as amikacin for 5 days, have been validated for the
      treatment of uncomplicated AP. Since the publication of studies demonstrating the
      non-inferiority of oral vs IV treatment, no controlled trial has been published to shorten
      the duration of antibiotic treatment for AP in children, whether oral or IV.

      There are currently 2 ongoing non-inferiority controlled clinical trials
      (http://clinicaltrials.gov) comparing a 5-day vs a 10-day oral treatment for urinary tract
      infection in children between 2 months and 5 years (NCT04400110), or a 7-day vs a 10-day oral
      treatment in children between 3 months and 7 years old (NCT03221504). A third controlled
      clinical trial (NCT01595529) has ended its inclusions ad performed analysis but not yet
      published in a peer-reviewed journal: it compared a 5-day vs a 10-day oral treatment for
      urinary tract infection (febrile or not) in children between 2 months and 10 years old. Both
      treatments resulted in high success rates (> 96%). The 5-day treatment tended to be inferior
      to the 10-day one (p=0.054). However, the study allowed 4 different oral therapies
      (Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, Cefixime, Cefdinir or Cephalexin) and results for each
      subgroup are not yet available. Moreover, antibiotic treatments modify the diversity of the
      gut microbiota. These disturbances, described as dysbiosis, are generally transient, but can
      lead to a lasting and stable modification of the gut microbiota, and be involved in the
      occurrence of chronic diseases in children as in adults.

      Third-generation cephalosporins (3GC), such as ceftriaxone, rapidly reduce the richness and
      diversity of the gut microbiota and also select subpopulations of resistant bacteria,
      particularly by acquisition of extended spectrum beta-lactamases, a major public health
      issue.

      There is no data on the impact of antibiotic relays on the gut microbiota. Since each
      antibiotic has its own anti-bacterial spectrum, a sequence of treatments could have an
      additive or even synergistic deleterious effect on the gut microbiota. This may in particular
      be the case in children treated with IV ceftriaxone for 3 days followed by cotrimoxazole for
      7 days, as recommended in France in first intention.

      3.0 Summary of relevant pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials

      1999 Hoberman et al. Oral versus initial intravenous therapy for urinary tract infections in
      young febrile children This was a non-inferiority study between oral cefixime for 14 days and
      intravenous ceftriaxone for 3 days followed by oral cefixime for 11 days. One of the outcomes
      was the occurrence of renal scarring. It included children aged 1 to 24 months. A total of
      306 children were included. Renal scarring at 6 months was noted in 9.8% children treated
      orally versus 7.2% of children treated intravenously. The study conclude that oral treatment
      was safe.

      The main limit of the study was the lower rate of renal scar in both arms compared to other
      studies, probably linked to a female/male sex ratio of 9:1 (with a median age of 8 months),
      when the sex ratio is in favour of boys before 1-year-old.

      2007, Montini et al. Antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis in children: multicentre
      randomised controlled non-inferiority trial This was a multicentre, randomised controlled,
      open labelled, parallel group, non-inferiority trial comparing oral co-amoxiclav for 10 days
      to parenteral ceftriaxone for three days, followed by oral co-amoxiclav for 7 days. Primary
      outcome was the rate of renal scarring after 12 months. A total of 502 children aged 1 month
      to <7 years with clinical pyelonephritis were included. Intention to treat analysis showed no
      significant differences between oral (n=244) and parenteral (n=258) treatment, both in the
      primary outcome (scarring scintigraphy at 12 months 27/197 (13.7%) v 36/203 (17.7%), and
      secondary outcomes: time to defervescence, white cell count at day 3, and percentage with
      sterile urine at day 3 (99.5% n both arms). The results were similar in the subgroups of
      children older and younger than 2 years (data not shown in the paper).

      2012, Boquet et al. Randomized trial of oral versus sequential IV/oral antibiotic for acute
      pyelonephritis in children PHRC AOM 04 105; NCT00136656 This was a non-inferiority study
      between oral cefixime for 10 days and IV ceftriaxone for 4 days followed by oral cefixime for
      6 days on the occurrence of renal scarring. It included children aged 1 to 36 mont with a
      first proven urinary tract infection and procalcitonin concentration ≥ 0.5 ng/mL s. The
      primary endpoint was the proportion of renal scar measured by 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy 6
      to 8 months after treatment. The study included a total 171 children of the 698 expected. The
      incidence of renal scarring was 30.8% in the oral treatment group and 27.3% for children who
      received the sequential treatment. The trial could not demonstrate statistically the
      non-inferiority due to insufficient enrolment.

      Comment: The protocol was demanding for participants: each child had a first 99mTc-DMSA renal
      scintigraphy upon diagnosis, and for those with abnormal scintigraphy, a second 6 to 8 months
      later to evaluate renal scar. All children also had a voiding cystography. The 99mTc-DMSA
      scintigraphy to measure renal scarring led to fewer than 12% lost to follow. The association
      of 2 9mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy probably limited the acceptance of the protocol, which
      explains that we chose to perform only one scintigraphy at the end of the evaluation.

      The higher renal scarring than in the study by Montini et al may in part be explained by the
      additional inclusion criteria of a procalcitonin concentration ≥ 0.5 ng/mL, a level being
      associated with renal scars

      anesthesia is preferred over another by patients getting LASIK. Before your LASIK procedure,
      you will be given a short questionnaire to determine the baseline comfort of your eyes. In
      the operating room, one type of anesthetic will be put in one eye, and the other medication
      will be put in the other eye. Which anesthetic you get in each eye will be chosen in a random
      way (similar to flipping a coin). After your LASIK surgery, the investigators will ask you if
      you felt more comfort in your right eye, your left eye, or if they were equal, and the
      investigators will ask you the same survey questions that were asked prior to your LASIK to
      get more details about your experience.

      *Of note- the randomization being done is for which eye will be receiving the lidocaine and
      which eye will be receiving the tetracaine. Each patient will receive lidocaine in 1 eye and
      tetracaine in the other eye, the randomization is for each individual eye. This means, of 11
      patients in our study, 22 eyes received treatment. 11 eyes received lidocaine and 11 eyes
      received tetracaine.

      when we did our comparison, 11 values were used for lidocaine and 11 eyes were used for
      tetracaine, giving a total of 22 eyes. This is important to note since the randomization
      refers to EYE for each individual patient, and not for the patient (ie: participant means 1
      eye, not 1 person in the descriptions below).

      Although several large well designed clinical trials have shown that erythropoietin which is
      commonly used to treat anemia associated with kidney disease, increases the risk of stroke
      and heart disease, the mechanism for this increased risk is unknown. The investigators'
      preliminary studies show that the adverse effects of erythropoietin are from activation of
      the heterodimeric erythropoietin/ beta common receptor which only occurs with high doses of
      erythropoietin. The investigators propose a clinical trial of 120 patients assigned to low
      doses of erythropoietin given more frequently or the same cumulative dose of erythropoietin
      administered as a high dose once every two weeks and assess effects on the beta common
      receptor activation, inflammation and vascular disease as evidence by MRI of the carotid
      arteries.
    ","Frequent, Low-Dose Erythropoietin A Mechanistic Approach to Mitigate Adverse Cardiovascular Effects of Erythropoietin","['Anemia', 'CKD', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiovascular']",Atherosclerosis,"
      Erythropoietin (EPO) is the most widely prescribed cytokine, yet the benefits and potential
      side effects of different dosing regimens are poorly understood. It is now recognized that
      erythropoietin administered at high doses to patients with chronic kidney disease, results in
      an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from heart disease and stroke. However, the
      mechanisms that mediate this increased risk of cardiovascular disease is not known. There are
      two receptors for erythropoietin the homodimeric EPO receptor (EPOR) and the heterodimeric
      beta common receptor ( CR)/EPOR. The investigators have demonstrated that activation of the
      heterodimeric CR/EPOR only occurs with high doses of EPO. Our exciting, published,
      preliminary data also demonstrates that the CR is in a complex with vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and that high doses of EPO activate VEGFR-2 through the
      CR, resulting in the deleterious effects of VEGFR-2 activation on the cardiovascular system.
      This is particularly important in patients with kidney disease since they are already at a
      high risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover in advanced kidney disease cyanate derived from
      the high urea levels can non-enzymatically form an amide bond with EPO. This carbamylated EPO
      (cEPO) has no effect on hemoglobin, but still activates the heterodimeric CR/EPOR. To date
      there have been no studies that have directly measured levels of cEPO or activation of the
      CR/EPOR in patients with kidney disease. Our hypothesis is that the administration of
      low-doses of EPO more frequently will result in lower levels of total and carbamylated
      erythropoietin decreased activation of VEGFR-2 via the heterodimeric CR/EPOR and consequently
      decreased inflammation and atherosclerosis. The investigators will directly test this
      hypothesis by randomly allocating 120 patients with chronic kidney disease to either low-
      dose EPO given thrice weekly or the same cumulative dose, a high-dose, administered once
      every 2 weeks. Our hypothesis predicts that low-dose EPO will be as effective at correcting
      anemia, but will demonstrate less progression of carotid artery plaque, as assessed by
      non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging, as compared to the high-dose, EPO given every 2
      weeks. To delineate how EPO affects blood vessels, the investigators will isolate endothelial
      cells from blood vessels in 20 patients who are assigned to low-dose EPO and 20 allocated to
      high-dose EPO. Within these cells the investigators will investigate the signaling pathways
      that are triggered by activation of CR/EPOR. In a substudy of 20 subjects with kidney disease
      randomized to low-dose EPO or to high-dose EPO, as well as 20 healthy controls receiving a
      single dose of high- or low-dose EPO, the investigators will determine how kidney function
      and dosing affects levels of total and carbamylated erythropoietin. The investigators' study
      will not only provide us with a thorough understanding of the mechanism by which EPO mediates
      the increased risk of atherosclerosis, but a clinical strategy to avoid the side effects of
      EPO therapy and a tool to quantify the cardiovascular risk of EPO and newer erythropoiesis
      stimulating agents by assessing activation of the heterodimeric CR/EPOR.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine administered to patients with
           gastric cancer pre- and post-gastrectomy and to compare this to historical data of
           capecitabine PK values in patients with other cancer types.

        -  To ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to PK data from the same
           patients prior to gastrectomy.

      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in patients
      who have undergone a total gastrectomy. The study also aims to establish the toxicity profile
      of capecitabine in these patients, to identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and to
      ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to PK data from the same patients prior
      to gastrectomy. Screening tests will consist of demographic details, complete medical
      history, physical exam, vital signs, tumour serum markers, haematology and biochemistry
      tests. There will also be an ECG, chest X-Ray or CT thorax, CT abdomen and a serum or urine
      pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential). Haematology and Biochemistry will be
      repeated prior to each study drug administration. All patients will receive 6 cycles of oral
      capecitabine chemotherapy at a dose of 625 mg/m2, administered twice daily at 12 hourly
      intervals for 21 consecutive days. Total proposed duration of therapy is 3 cycles
      pre-operatively and 3 cycles post-operatively. Capecitabine and its metabolites (DFCR, DFUR
      and 5-FU) plasma levels will be measured during the 1st and 4th cycles in all patients.
      Treatment should continue for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of disease progression, or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cognitive deficits are some of the most prominent and disabling symptoms of schizophrenia.
      Evidence suggests that schizophrenia involves alterations to the functioning of a neural
      system under the control of a brain chemical called GABA. The present project will compare
      the effects of low-dose clonazepam (at a sub-sedating dose) to placebo, for effects on GABA-
      modulated brain activity measured by EEG, and associated cognitive processes in people who
      have schizophrenia.
    ",Clonazepam Effects on Brain Oscillations and Cognition in Schizophrenia,"['Schizophrenia', 'Schizoaffective Disorder', 'Schizophreniform Disorder']","['Schizophrenia', 'Psychotic Disorders']","
      Schizophrenia is a common, disabling mental illness with a considerable public health impact.
      Cognitive dysfunction (e.g in attention, memory, etc.) is an enduring feature of the illness,
      a strong predictor of functional outcome, and presently has no established treatment.
      Therefore, advances in treatment of cognition in schizophrenia are likely to alleviate a
      significant health burden. Deficits in executive control functions, such as those measurable
      on task-switching paradigms, are among the most important cognitive deficits in
      schizophrenia, and arise from disturbances in distributed neural networks operated by the
      prefrontal cortex. An important phenomenon that underpins cortical information processing are
      oscillations in brain activity that can be measured both with intracranial electrical
      recordings and at the scalp with EEG. These networks and their cortical oscillatory
      signatures are also strongly modulated by cortical interneurons that use gamma-amino butyric
      acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. Post-mortem evidence suggests that GABAergic neurons are
      altered in schizophrenia. Furthermore, studies in animals, using optogenetic manipulations
      that are restricted to a subset of cortical GABA neurons, also suggest that GABA neurons can
      be selectively modulated to improve PFC-dependent cognition in animal models of
      schizophrenia. This includes experiments that involve administration of sub-sedating doses of
      clonazepam, a representative FDA-approved medication from the benzodiazepine class.

      Therefore, this neurochemical system represents a novel set of candidate treatment targets
      that are both implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the potential
      remediation of associated cognitive dysfunction.

      The present study is designed to investigate the beneficial effects of adjunctive

    ",Santeon-CAP; Dexamethasone in Community-acquired Pneumonia,Community-acquired Pneumonia,Pneumonia,"
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infection. Approximately 20 percent of all
      episodes of pneumonia result in hospitalization. It is the leading cause of
      community-acquired infection requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In pulmonary
      infections, the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators from alveolar
      macrophages serves as a mechanism by which invading pathogens are eliminated. However, this
      reaction of the innate immune system can be potentially harmful when excessive release of
      circulating inflammatory cytokines causes damage to the patient, particularly the lung.
      Interest in the role of corticosteroids in the pathophysiology of critical illness has
      existed since the early part of the 20th century. On ICU, early treatment with
      corticosteroids to attenuate systemic inflammation is widespread. At the same time, outside
      the ICU little evidence is available on the effect of treatment with corticosteroids in
      patients diagnosed with CAP. Theoretically, early initiated administration of corticosteroids
      in the course of a CAP can lower systemic and pulmonary inflammation. This may lead to
      earlier resolution of pneumonia and a reduction of complications (sepsis, mortality).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether catheter based ablation is better than
      conventional anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy for reducing recurrent shocks in patients
      with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The second purpose of the study is to
      determine the safety of catheter-based ablation and the effect on quality of life of
      patients.

      The study hypothesis is that catheter ablation is superior to AAD therapy in preventing
      recurrent ventricular arrhythmia in such subjects. This is a pilot trial which will provide
      data regarding recruitment potential and the feasibility of conducting a larger trial.
    ",Anti-arrhythmic Therapy vs Catheter Ablation as First Line Treatment for AICD Shock Prevention,"['Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia']","['Arrhythmias, Cardiac', 'Tachycardia', 'Tachycardia, Ventricular']","
      AAD and catheter ablation have been shown to reduce the incidence of recurrent AICD shocks.
      The disadvantages of AAD include side effects from medications and the lack of compliance
      during long-term therapy. Previous trials have demonstrated the feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of catheter ablation as ""first-line"" treatment for reducing recurrent ventricular
      arrhythmia and AICD shocks in this subject population. However, these catheter ablation
      trials did not systematically compare the efficacy of catheter ablation with AAD therapy.
      While both treatment strategies have been shown to be effective in this setting it is unclear
      how they compare with each other in preventing AICD shocks.

      This is a single centre, parallel group, two-arm, unblinded randomized vanguard pilot trial
      comparing catheter ablation with AAD therapy for preventing recurrent AICD shocks.

      Eligible and consenting subjects will be equally randomized to receive either AAD therapy or
      a catheter ablation procedure.

      A 30-day treatment period will be provided to allow for adequate time to implement the two
      treatments.

      Subjects randomized to the antiarrhythmic therapy arm will receive clinically effective
      loading doses of either sotalol, mexiletine, procainamide or amiodarone (oral or IV) alone or
      in combination, as chosen by the study investigator.

      Subjects randomized to the catheter ablation arm will undergo the procedure within the 30
      treatment period. Concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone or other AAD will be
      avoided if possible in the ablation group. However, AAD may be used to suppress ventricular
      arrhythmia resulting in AICD shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) while waiting for the
      catheter ablation procedure.

      Subjects will be seen for a baseline randomization visit, then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after
      enrollment and every 3 months thereafter until the end of the study. Subjects will be
      followed up for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months.

      Quality of life questionnaires will be done at each visit. Standard of care blood work, chest
      x-ray, and ECG will be done in the AAD arm depending on the AAD chosen as treatment. ICD
      programming will be standardized for all subjects.

    ",Varenicline Treatment in Alcohol and Nicotine Dependent Patients With Schizophrenia,"['Schizophrenia', 'Schizoaffective Disorder', 'Alcohol Dependence', 'Nicotine Dependence']","['Alcoholism', 'Tobacco Use Disorder', 'Schizophrenia', 'Psychotic Disorders']","
      Alcohol use (more than 33%) and smoking (80-90%) commonly occur together in patients with
      schizophrenia. Varenicline (ChantixTM) has been approved by the FDA as a medication for
      smoking cessation. Recent animal studies have shown that chronic varenicline administration
      decreased alcohol consumption. There are no human data available on the effectiveness of
      varenicline in alcohol-use disorders.

      The aim of the proposed pilot study is to find out whether varenicline treatment decreases
      alcohol use and smoking in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
      Varenicline may also improve cognition (memory and concentration) and negative symptoms (e.g.
      poor attention, poverty of speech, apathy, affective flattening, anhedonia) in patients with
      schizophrenia and comorbid nicotine and alcohol dependence.

      The proposed pilot study will enroll a cohort of up to 30 subjects with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder and nicotine and alcohol dependence, who are receiving ongoing
      outpatient mental health treatment from community providers. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups (varenicline vs. placebo). Following a one week
      screening phase, participants will be seen on day 4, day 8, then weekly over an 8-week
      treatment period. One week supply of medication will be dispensed at each study visit, with
      the exception of the first week, when only 4 days supply will be given on 2 days (visit 1 and
      2). One month after discontinuation of medication, a follow-up interview will be conducted.

      Varenicline and placebo will be dispensed in 0.5 mg and 1 mg color coded capsules. During the
      first 3 days of treatment, participants will take one 0.5 mg tablet of varenicline (or
      placebo) by mouth daily. If the medication is well-tolerated, the dose will be increased to
      0.5 mg by mouth twice daily for 4 days. From day 8, the dose will be increased to the
      standard dosing schedule of 1 mg (1 tablet) by mouth twice daily. At the end of the 8th week,
      varenicline will be discontinued.

      A structured clinical psychiatric interview and physical exam will be performed at baseline,
      along with a urine drug screen, which will be repeated on week 8, and at 1 month follow-up.
      Blood tests (complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests) will be
      performed at baseline, then monthly.

      During weekly study visits patients will undergo breath carbon-monoxide and breath alcohol
      testing, and they will answer questions about depression, smoking and alcohol use. Detailed
      assessment of psychiatric symptom severity (including neuropsychological testing) will be
      performed at baseline, at the end of the treatment phase (week 8). A functional MRI study
      will be performed at baseline and at the end of study to assess changes in blood flow,
      emotional processing and working memory related to varenicline treatment. In addition,
      genetic polymorphism of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and gene expression changes
      related to drinking/smoking/psychosis and varenicline treatment will also be assessed.

      The primary objectives of the proposed study are two fold: first to determine the feasibility
      of conducting a similar study on a larger scale, and second to establish pilot data for
      determining the effect size for hypothesized treatment effects on alcohol and nicotine use
      based on objective tests and self report. These estimates will help inform the minimum sample
      size needed for a larger future trial.

      The investigators propose to study the patterns of metabolite changes in subjects with asthma

    ",Asthma/Steroid Withdrawal Study,Asthma,Asthma,"
      Methods:

      We propose to study 20, non-smoking, asthmatic adults. Subjects will be recruited from
      outpatient asthma clinics in Edmonton. All subjects will meet GINA criteria for mild
      persistent to moderate persistent asthma. Following informed consent we will obtain blood,
      induced sputum and urine samples after an overnight fast and free of any caffeine for at
      least 24 hours. We will also obtain routine demographic information including age, sex, and
      usual asthma medication usage. We will obtain health related quality of life status using
      generic (15D) and disease specific (Asthma Quality of Life) questionnaires. Subjects will be
      instructed regarding use of peak flow meters and the typical symptoms associated with loss of
      asthma control. They will be instructed regarding accessing a dedicated asthma website that
      incorporates the above questions (Visit 1). There is also a place for subjects to enter twice
      daily peak flow measurements. The website is password protected and each subject can access
      only their own individualized data entry pages. A research coordinator is able to access any
      subject data again using a unique password. We will use this internet-based program to
      monitor daily PEF and daily asthma symptoms. Patients will be instructed to access the
      website daily and will reassessed at 2 weeks. Subjects will then be instructed to continue
      with their usual asthma management and to log on to the asthma website daily to record
      symptoms and twice daily peak flows. Only subjects meeting criteria for well controlled
      asthma (GOAL criteria) along with objective compliance with study protocols over 2 weeks will
      then be enrolled in the next phase of the study.

      Phase 1. After two weeks, subjects will return (Visit 2). At this time a blood (10 ml) and
      urine sample will be obtained and stored for subsequent metabolomic analysis. An exhaled gas
      sample will be collected and analyzed for nitric oxide concentration using a sensitive
      chemiluminescence technique. An induced sputum sample will also be obtained using
      standardized protocols and cell count and differential will be determined. The remainder of
      the sputum sample will also be stored for subsequent analysis. All tests will be performed in
      the morning after an overnight fast.

      Phase 2. During the second phase of the study, subjects will be instructed to reduce their
      controller medication (inhaled corticosteroid alone or combined inhaled corticosteroid with
      long acting beta 2 agonist) by 50% e.g. from 4 puffs daily to 2 puffs daily. Subjects will
      log on to their website daily for 4 weeks or until they experience a mild exacerbation (see
      definition below). If they experience a clinical exacerbation, they will be instructed to
      return to the hospital site where repeat blood, urine, exhaled air and sputum testing will be
      obtained (Visit 3a). They will be instructed to increase their controller medication and to
      continue with the increased steroid phase of the study. Those not experiencing a clinical
      exacerbation will return to the hospital site at the end of the four weeks (Visit 3b). They
      will have repeat blood, urine and sputum samples and will then be instructed to eliminate
      controller medication for four weeks or until they experience a clinical exacerbation. Those
      experiencing a clinical exacerbation will be treated as outlined above. Those continuing to
      experience clinical good control will be brought back at four weeks for repeat blood, urine,
      exhaled air and sputum analysis (Visit 3c). Throughout the 4-8 week period of inhaled steroid
      withdrawal, patients will be asked to save a urine sample three times weekly. These samples
      will be stored in pre-labeled containers in their freezer until picked up by the study
      coordinator at weekly intervals.

      Phase 3. After a patient experiences a mild exacerbation or at the end of 8 weeks of steroid
      reduction and elimination, patients will enter the final phase of the study. At that time all
      patients will be instructed to increase their controller medication back to their baseline
      values. They will be followed for four weeks and repeat blood, urine, exhaled air and sputum
      samples will be obtained (Visit 4). Finally, subjects will be instructed to double their
      usual controller medication for four weeks after which repeat blood, urine and sputum samples
      will be obtained. Again, subjects will collect and store urine samples at a frequency of 3
      times per week. The subjects will then be instructed to resume their usual asthma controller
      medication dosing and the study will be complete (Visit 5). All tests will be performed in
      the morning after an overnight fast.

      A mild exacerbation will be defined by any one of the following events:

        1. A decrease in peak flow to less than 80% of best effort for two consecutive days.

        2. An increase in reliever medication (fast acting beta 2 agonist) by 50% over baseline
           needs for two consecutive days

        3. Waking at night due to asthma on two consecutive nights A severe exacerbation will be
           defined as any need for additional medical contact for treatment of asthma (e.g.
           Emergency Room, Walk-in Clinic) or any hospital admission for asthma. The need for oral
           corticosteroids will also constitute a severe exacerbation. If at any point the subjects
           undergo a severe exacerbation, they will be examined by either their own treating
           physician or by one of the physicians associated with this study and appropriate
           escalation of treatment will be commenced. The REB will be informed of all severe
           exacerbations. The study coordinator and one of the study physicians will be available
           by pager around the clock during the course of the study.

      The purpose of this study is to learn the following: whether long-term treatment (6 months)
      with fenofibrate will decrease burn related sugar and fat increased in the blood and help
      prevent muscle loss and improve wound healing.
    ",Acute and Long-Term Outcome Investigations of Fenofibrate on Severely Burned Patients,Second or Third Degree Burns,,"
      Following severe burn injury in human patients the mitochondrial fat oxygenation capacity is
      decreased in muscle. This is associated with a corresponding progression in the severity of
      the resistance to the action of insulin on glucose disposal and protein synthesis and
      breakdown in muscle, regenerating wound and liver.

      Fatty acids or their active intracellular products ( e.g. Diacylglycerol, acyl- Coenzyme
      A(CoA) or acylcarnitine) are the direct inhibitors of insulin action, rather than tissue
      triglycerides(TG) itself. In other words, impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxygenation is
      the mechanism that causes altered lipid metabolism that ultimately contributes to insulin
      resistance.

      Accumulation of active fatty acid products, such as Diacylglycerol, acyl-CoA or acylcarnitine
      esters in muscle cells is due to the rate of uptake of plasma free fatty acids(FFA) exceeding
      the rate of oxygenation within muscle due principally to a reduced capacity of mitochondria
      to oxidize fatty acids.

      Decreasing insulin sensitivity in muscle is related to impaired insulin signaling. This will
      be reflected by increased activity of protein kinase C (PKC). Because PKC is thought to exert
      its regulatory effect primarily on either tyrosine kinase activity on the insulin receptor or
      downstream kinase insulin receptor substrate (IRS) phosphorylation, these elements of the
      insulin signaling cascade will be decreased. In turn, elements of insulin signaling related
      to the response of muscle glucose (PI3 Kinase) and protein (P70S6k)metabolism will be
      reduced. The investigators propose that increased tissue PKC activity will be associated with
      increased tissue concentration of Diacylglycerol, acyl-CoA or acylcarnitine. The
      investigators hypothesize that the treatment of patients with the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha antagonist fenofibrate will improve
      mitochondrial capacity to oxidize fatty acids. Insulin sensitivity in muscle, skin and liver
      in terms of both glucose and protein metabolism will be improved by fenofibrate treatment.

      High-dose vitamin A to children above 6 months of age reduces all-cause mortality by 23-30%.
      The WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation (VAS) with the first vaccine after 6 months of
      age. However, the effect of providing VAS with vaccines has never been investigated. We have
      hypothesised that the effect of VAS depends on the immune stimulus at the time of
      supplementation. Hence, the effect might vary depending on which type of vaccine it is given
      with. In particular, we hypothesised that VAS might be beneficial when given with measles
      vaccine but not when given with DTP vaccine. Normally the first vaccine after 6 months of age
      would be a measles vaccine, but many children come late for their DTP vaccinations and
      receive DTP alone or together with measles vaccine. Hence, it is important to study whether
      the effect of VAS is the same irrespective of the vaccine(s) administered at the same time.

      Guinea-Bissau has not yet implemented the WHO vitamin A policy of providing VAS with
      vaccines, but plans to do so within the next years. Together with the Ministry of Health in
      Guinea-Bissau, the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau will investigate the effect
      on mortality and morbidity of implementing the WHO vitamin A policy in Guinea-Bissau. This
      will be done in a large randomised trial.

      BHP has a demographic surveillance system (DSS) which has followed a population of now more
      than 150,000 individuals for almost 30 years. Children will be randomised to receive VAS or
      placebo with their first vaccine after 6 months of age, and will be followed through the DSS
      to assess mortality and morbidity. Based on previous observations, the effects of VAS might
      differ according to sex and season. The interaction between VAS, sex, and season will also be
      studied in the present trial. By identifying situations where VAS may be beneficial,
      ineffective, or even harmful the study may contribute importantly to optimising the VAS
      policy for low-income countries.

      Low blood concentrations of THC and alcohol appear to have a minimal effect on driving
      performance.However, there is a gap in the literature about the combined effects of THC and
      alcohol. There is little empirical evidence to determine whether the combination of THC and
      alcohol could be additive or multiplicative. This issue is particularly important when
      dealing with concentrations that are just below legal thresholds - it is important to
      identify if someone who may have consumed cannabis and alcohol, in quantities that do not
      exceed legal thresholds, may nonetheless be impaired to drive. Answering this question
      requires more research on the combined effects of THC and alcohol under tightly controlled
      experimental conditions. Hence, the purpose of this study is to determine the additive (or
      multiplicative) effect of standardized low doses of cannabis, in combination with low-doses
      of alcohol, on a number of outcome measures related to driving. The investigators will focus
      specifically on the effect of low blood concentrations of THC (0, 125, and 250 µg/kg) alone
      and in combination with low blood concentrations of alcohol (BAC 0%, .025%, and .049%). They
      shall determine the combined effect of THC and alcohol on physiological, cognitive,
      subjective measures of impairment, and simulated driving. This study will focus on younger
      adults because they have higher impaired driving rates than other age groups. As a secondary
      aim of the study, the investigators will examine whether previous driving and drug use
      history are correlated with driving decisions during the simulated drive and subjective
      measures. This study will contribute to the evidence base informing legislation, policy
      making, and law enforcement. This study is particularly timely given upcoming changes in
      legislation about cannabis, and because the combination of THC and alcohol, even below legal
      thresholds, may lead to impaired driving and crashes.

      If someone is diagnosed with a pituitary tumor that causes acromegaly (too much growth
      hormone) the treatment is to have it surgically removed. This study has two phases.

      The first phase provides medical treatment with a drug that will be provided for 3 months
      before surgery to see if complications of surgery are reduced and to see whether or not
      remission improves following surgery if you have this medical treatment. The drug
      administered is approved by the FDA for long-term treatment of acromegaly. It is not
      routinely administered before surgery, and is therefore experimental as used in this way. All
      other procedures performed during this research are standard of care with the exception of
      the 3 questionnaires to be completed at each visit.

      The second phase of this study is from 3 months until 12 months after surgery and is only for
      people who do not go into remission after the operation. This phase assesses the possible
      remission of acromegaly after resuming the drug treatment for an additional 3 to 9 months.
      The drug will be prescribed by your physician as part of your regular medical care and will
      not be included as part of the study. All other procedures performed during this research are
      standard of care with the exception of the 3 questionnaires to be completed at each visit.

    ",Forced Air Versus Endovascular Warming in Polytrauma Patients,"['Polytrauma', 'Hypothermia']","['Hypothermia', 'Multiple Trauma']","
      Trauma is the leading cause of death in young adults and a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality at all ages. The acute problem is often uncontrollable bleeding. Subsequently,
      infection becomes a leading cause of morbidity. Polytrauma patients are at high risk for
      accidental hypothermia. Mild perioperative hypothermia causes a coagulopathy that
      significantly augments blood loss and increases allogeneic transfusion requirements.
      Hypothermia also impairs numerous immune functions - even slight decreases in core
      temperature triple the risk of surgical wound infection.

      Endovascular temperature management system Alsius® (ICY, Alsius Corporation:
      Irvine,California,USA) has been approved in Europe and United States for the past 10 years
      and has been used in thousands of patients mainly for the indication of therapeutic cooling
      and subsequently rewarming of patients. A major potential advantage of this system is that
      heat is directly added to the thermal core, thus bypassing the heat sink and insulating
      effects of peripheral tissues. The efficacy of this system is sufficient to allow rapid
      rewarming in hypothermic trauma victims, even those undergoing major surgery. We therefore
      propose to test the hypothesis that polytrauma patients rewarmed with the Alsius® system will
      have better patient outcome (combined perioperative morbidity) than those warmed
      conventionally with forced-air.

      Constipation is a known complication of the postoperative period after spinal surgery, where

      We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a single, academic
      tertiary center (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) from 2017 to 2018. Adult male
      and female patients between the ages of 18 and 80 who were planned to undergo non-urgent,
      elective posterior-approach spinal fusion surgeries by the Department of Neurosurgery were
      eligible for inclusion. Of note, patients with preexisting opioid and/or laxative use were
      still considered eligible and patients were not stratified according to these
      characteristics. Once a surgeon and the patient made a joint decision to proceed with
      elective, posterior spinal fusion surgery, patients would be approached by study personnel,
      with all eligible patients recruited independently of their surgeon to ensure no conflict of
      interest. After informed consent, eligible patients provided baseline demographic information
      including age, sex, race, pre-operative laxative use, and pre-operative opioid use. In
      addition, subjects completed a Bowel Function Index (BFI), a validated measure of
      opioid-induced constipation.10 Patients were not instructed to alter their daily regimen from

      Botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) prevents the release of acetylcholine in presynaptic terminals of
      the neuromuscular junction. It has been proposed to be effective in spastic conditions of the
      head and neck including oromandibular dystonias, bruxism, and muscular hypertrophy (1,2,3,4).
      However, only one randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial has been completed
      involving 20 patients demonstrating both objective and subjective improvement in the BTX-A
      treated group over those treated with saline at one week, one month, and six months (5).

      Currently, in most orofacial pain practices, when the diagnosis of masticatory myofascial
      pain in the head region is made, patients are treated with a standard myofascial protocol.
      This protocol involves stretching, application of moist heat, spray and stretch, and
      lidocaine trigger point injections into the masticatory muscles. This is considered the
      standard of care among most orofacial pain practioners.

      There have been no randomized, double-blinded, head-to-head trials comparing BTX-A injections
      to lidocaine injections in the treatment of masticatory myofacial pain. Moreover, in all
      studies, muscles were targeted using surface landmarks with no confirmatory tests to
      guarantee the medication was administered to the intended muscle. In previous studies, the
      medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, important masticatory muscles that is often hyperactive
      in masticatory myofacial pain was not injected due to lack of palpable surface landmarks.
      Ultrasound and electromyography (EMG) guidance will help us locate these muscles.

      The purpose of this study is to objectively measure functional improvement in patients with
      masticatory myofascial pain injected with lidocaine versus BTX-A. A pilot study enrolling 20
      patients is proposed. 20 patients will be randomized to receive either BTX-A or lidocaine
      injections into the bilateral temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoid.
      Objective and subjective clinical parameters will be measured. These include pain at rest and
      with chewing, maximum non-assisted and assisted mouth opening, protrusive and laterotrusive
      jaw movements, subjective efficacy of treatment, and side-effects of treatment. Patients will
      be assessed at baseline, one week, one month, and three months after the procedure.

      After a liver transplant, the hepatitis C virus (which destroyed one's own liver) eventually
      comes back. In many patients, this will eventually cause the loss of the new liver and can
      also confuse the doctors taking care of them because it is hard to tell the difference
      between one's body rejecting the new liver and hepatitis. This can cause serious treatment
      errors that can lead to more severe hepatitis or to rejection of the liver. Some of the drugs
      used to prevent rejection of one's new liver can cause the hepatitis to come back in a more
      severe form. This is especially true for the drugs known as corticosteroids.

      Right now, the only effective treatment against hepatitis C is a combination of two drugs
      called interferon and ribavirin. These drugs act by strengthening one's immune system to
      fight the virus and by directly reducing the reproduction of the virus. Because the treatment
      with these drugs is associated with many side effects, there is little experience with
      treating patients after liver transplantation with them.

      In the investigators' transplant program, they have decided to treat all patients with
      hepatitis C as early as possible after transplantation and to follow them closely for the
      development of hepatitis and side effects of the treatment. The investigators treat one's
      hepatitis as early as possible, before any actual damage has occurred in the new liver. This
      approach has been tried before but it has been hard to tell if it has worked or not. The main
      reason for failure was that many patients could not complete the treatment due to side
      effects. The investigators' purpose is to treat those side effects aggressively so that most
      patients can complete the treatment course.

      The purpose of this study is to collect all the data regarding the investigators' treatment
      protocol so that they will be able to learn if this form of treatment is beneficial.

      The study includes performing liver biopsies at scheduled times after one's liver transplant
      and for scheduled blood tests to see how much virus is still in the blood. If patients show
      signs that they are not responding to treatment they will be removed from the study.
    ",Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT) Recipients With Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Under Preemptive Treatment,Hepatitis C,"['Hepatitis A', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis']","
      HCV recurs in the transplanted liver almost invariably. The clinical course is variable and
      ranges from no hepatitis to severe aggressive hepatitis with cirrhosis. Factors that affect
      outcome are high viral load prior to OLT, genotype, and immunosuppressive regimen. Recent
      studies indicate that the severity of recurrence is increasing with longer follow up, and
      longevity of both graft and patient is compromised by HCV. Viral load appears to be
      particularly affected by corticosteroids. The impact of mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus
      is not certain. The results of re-transplantation are generally poor and seem to be a
      non-cost beneficial way to deal with recurrence HCV cirrhosis. Additionally,
      re-transplantation deprives other patients from getting OLT in a timely fashion.

      Recent studies have shown that with intensive alpha interferon and ribavirin treatment, up to
      40% of patients can be cleared of virus as measured by PCR. Thus, despite the cost and side
      effects of this treatment, it appears justified to treat recurrence preemptively.

      Due to the deleterious effects of high dose Corticosteroids it seems logical to attempt to
      withdraw them as soon as possible from treatment. MMF is often incompatible with interferon
      and ribavirin treatment due to leukopenia and anemia. The same is true for sirolimus. Thus,
      most patients will eventually be treated with Tacrolimus monotherapy. Presently, numerous
      patients end up being treated with Tacrolimus monotherapy as part of the reduction in immune
      suppression, which occurs over time. There is, however, very little prospective data
      regarding Tacrolimus monotherapy and almost no data on the specific issue of monotherapy in
      HCV patients. Even less is known with respect to this type of treatment while using
      interferon and ribavirin.

      Our purpose in this protocol is to examine both the effect of preemptive antiviral treatment
      on recurrent HCV and the effect of Tacrolimus monotherapy in this setting. This may be
      important as more and more programs are turning to preemptive anti viral treatment and the
      issue of appropriate immune suppression becomes seminal to this discussion.

      This is a feasibility study requiring only three patients to serve as a proof of concept that
      gadoxetate disodium (a liver specific contrast agent) can be used to improve images taken
      just before liver SBRT treatments.

      The hypothesis of this research is that if gadoxetate disodium improves image quality at the
      time of treatment, then it can be used for image guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Image guidance
      is the procedure where the 3D CT image that is used to plan a radiotherapy treatment, is
      aligned to a 3D image taken just before treatment. The better the alignment, the more
      accurate the treatment, which is crucial for high dose treatments such as SBRT.

      This research is important for two main reasons. First, it is much less invasive than the
      standard of care which involves surgically implanting markers in the liver that can move over
      time. The benefit to harm ratio for surgery, compared to an injection, is much more dramatic.
      Furthermore, not all patients are surgical candidates, and therefore in those cases radiation
      oncologists must prescribed a larger area to treat to ensure that none of the cancerous
      region is missed. The drawback to this method is the irradiation of more normal tissue than
      necessary, which although deemed to have a greater benefit than harm, is not ideal. Secondly,
      this research has strong implications in the field of radiation oncology to move towards
      patient oriented radiotherapy treatments. If successful, radiation treatment to the liver
      could be performed in less treatments because of the confidence given to radiation
      oncologists of the cancer location; knowing exactly the healthy liver regions to avoid.
    ",Improving CBCT for Liver IG-SBRT Using Gadoxetate Disodium,"['Primary Liver Cancer', 'Metastatic Liver Cancer']",Liver Neoplasms,"
      Preliminary testing has already been performed and proves the notion that to achieve adequate
      image quality in a CT imaging phantom, at least 4 times the MRI administration dose would be
      required. These conclusions were supported qualitatively by a radiologist, radiation
      oncologist, and medical physicist, while also being backed up by quantitative measurement
      that has been accepted in the medical imaging literature. It is important for this work to
      first ensure that the imaging system is optimized, to have confidence that it will be
      successful for patients. Therefore before this study begins, substantial time and effort will
      be spent using phantoms and optimizing the imaging parameters and protocol.

      The current procedure for a patient that presents with liver cancer begins with a referral
      from the patient's primary care physician for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A
      radiation oncologist makes the decision whether the patient is suitable for SBRT.

      If the patient is deemed acceptable by the radiation oncologist, the next step is to undergo
      diagnostic imaging so that the radiation oncologist can identify where exactly the disease is
      located, and start the SBRT plan. Using the diagnostic images, the radiation oncologist
      outlines the areas to treat, as well as the areas that they want to spare. This information
      is given to a physicist who then plans the optimal way of delivering radiation based on the
      oncologist's specifications. Once the plan is approved by the radiation oncologist, the
      patient can be treated.

      At the time of treatment, the patient is placed in an immobilization device on a treatment
      couch by a radiation therapist. Once the patient is immobilized, an x-ray imaging system that
      is attached to the treatment machine extends out towards the patient. The machine performs a
      180-degree rotation with continuous x-ray imaging. Once sufficient imaging has been
      performed, the therapists then align these images with the previous diagnostic CT image that
      was used to plan the radiation treatment. This alignment process tells the radiation
      therapists how much to adjust the patient on the treatment couch to ensure the most accurate
      treatment delivery. Once the patient is in the proper position, the radiation treatment is
      delivered and then the patient can leave.

      The treatment procedure is then performed on five separate days each separated by 48 hours.

      The proposed research follows the same procedure with addition of a contrast injection at the
      treatment stage. A consent form will be given to the patient entailing the purpose of this
      study. It will highlight the risks and benefits of receiving contrast prior to the radiation
      treatment, as well as a complete outline of the research. If the patient consents to
      receiving an intravenous contrast injection of gadoxetate disodium then the treatment
      procedure will change as follows:

      Before the patient is placed in the immobilization device, a MRI technologist with experience
      giving gadoxetate disodium injections will give the prescribed injection according to the
      patient's body weight. After the injection is given, a liver SBRT trained radiation therapist
      will lead the patient to the treatment machine and set them up in the immobilization device
      as per standard treatments. The same time-of-treatment imaging will be performed, with the
      hypothesis that the image quality will improve because of the addition of the contrast agent.
      The contrast agent will only be administered at the first treatment because of the limited
      data on repeat injections of the drug in humans. Furthermore, for the first treatment when
      contrast is administered, a radiation oncologist, radiologist, medical physicist, MRI
      technologist, and three radiation therapists will attend.

      The patient will then be monitored for another 30 minutes with support equipment ready in the
      rare event that a side effect occurs.

      As per standard treatments, the radiation oncologist will follow up with patients at regular
      intervals during and after treatment, making sure to check with the patient for possible side
      effects of using the contrast agent.

      Although oral antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment of inflammatory acne for 30
      years, studies comparing their efficacy have little scientific value.

      Evidence-based dermatology proves minocycline to be an effective treatment for acne vulgaris
      while the patient remains on the medication; however, the relapse rate of acne after a course
      of antibiotics has never been established.

      The relapse rate would appear to be significant, as repeated courses and long-term antibiotic
      use are commonly prescribed in practice. The increasing problem of drug resistance has raised
      issues of the suitability of such long term antibiotic treatment and this overuse is probably
      a contributing factor of multiple drug resistance in our society.

      function.

      Visit 1 (V1): Patients, who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be asked to
      visit the sites 1 week after the screening visit (+/-2 days), following a 12-hour fast. Three
      measurements of office BP at the level of brachial artery, with a three minutes interval
      between each measurement, will be performed with the use of a mercury sphygmomanometer, after
      10 minutes-rest in the sitting posture (cuff with bladder size encircling at least 80% of arm
      circumference and covering two thirds of arm length). After that, venous blood specimens and
      a spot urine specimen will be collected for relevant blood tests and albumin/creatinine ratio
      (ACR) respectively. Subsequently, the Mobil-O-Graph monitor with a cuff of appropriate size
      will be fitted and the BP recording will be initiated for 24 hours. The device will be
      programmed to collect data every 20 minutes, except for 23:00 to 07:00 (data collection every
      30 minutes).

      Visit 2 (V2): An appointment will be scheduled the following day for the patient to drop-off
      the Mobil-O-Graph device. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the dapagliflozin or
      placebo group and will start receiving the drug regimen the same day. Moreover, all patients
      will receive dietary and lifestyle advice commencing from this visit.

      Telephone Visit 1 (ΤV1): A telephone visit (TV1) will be scheduled 6 weeks after V2 (+/-2
      days). Patient history will be obtained, emphasizing on possible adverse events during the
      previous 6 weeks. Home blood glucose levels, if available, would be also discussed.

      Visit 3 (V3): Visit 3 will be scheduled 6 weeks after telephone visit 1 (TV1) (+/-2 days).
      The following parameters will be determined: medical history of the last weeks, clinical
      examination (including three brachial BP measurements with a mercury sphygmomanometer as
      mentioned before), venous blood specimen collection (under 12-hour fast) and the initiation
      of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) (Mobil-O-Graph device). The patients
      will also provide a spot urine specimen for ACR evaluation.

      Visit 4 (V4): Visit 4 will be scheduled 1 day after visit 3. Patients will drop-off the
      Mobil-O-Graph device.

      Creatine as a new therapeutic strategy in depression:

      A double-blind, parallel, randomized, add-on clinical trial of creatine versus placebo added

      Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis, being a temporal and spatial
      buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of the cellular energy currency adenosine
      triphosphate (Wyss & Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000). Recent studies have suggested increased brain
      utilization of oxygen following oral creatine supplementation (Persky & Brazeua, 2001).
      Creatine supplementation is widely used in enhancing sports performance, and has been tried
      in the treatment of neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease with a paucity of
      side effects (Persky & Brazeua, 2001).

      Creatine enters the brain via a specialized sodium dependent transporter. Dechent et al
      (1999) studied the effect of oral creatine supplementation of 20g/day for 4 wk demonstrating
      a significant increase of mean concentration of total creatine across brain regions (8.7%
      corresponding to 0.6mM, P < 0.001). Lyoo et al (2003) studied magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      of high-energy phosphate metabolites in human brain following oral supplementation of
      creatine reporting that creatine (0.3 g/kg/day for the first 7 days and 0.03 g/kg/day for the
      next 7 days) significantly increased brain creatine levels.

      Accumulated evidence suggests the possible involvement of altered cerebral energy metabolism
      in the pathophysiology of depression (Mayberg, 1994). Functional brain imaging studies
      (positron and single photon emission tomography) have shown decreased blood flow and
      metabolism in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia in unipolar depression (Kennedy et al,
      2001; Derevets et al, 2002).

      Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have studied brain levels of
      creatine-containing compounds. Kato et al (1992) reported that phosphocreatine was
      significantly decreased in severely (as opposed to mildly) depressed patients. Dager et al
      (2004) studied depressed or mixed-state bipolar patients using two-dimensional proton
      echo-planar spectroscopic imaging, reporting an inverse correlation between severity of
      depression and white matter creatine levels.

      Finally, several studies suggest that agents with reported antidepressant activity may
      increase brain levels of creatine containing compounds. Sartorius et al (2003) used MRS to
      study metabolic changes in the hippocampus of rats and demonstrated a significant creatine
      level rise induced by electroconvulsive shock treatment occurring specifically in the group
      of animals which had exhibited depression-like [learned helplessness] behaviour before the
      ECT.

      S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and acetyl-L-carnitine - both reported to have antidepressant
      effects - have increased brain phosphocreatine levels in healthy subjects (Silveri et al,
      2003) and in geriatric depressed patients (Pettegrew et al, 2002) respectively.

      Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of using oral creatine supplementation
      to increase brain levels of creatine containing compounds and therefore, most likely by
      modifying high-energy phosphate metabolism in hypoactive brain areas, to treat subjects with
      major depression.

      Open study of creatine in depression: A preliminary open study of creatine monohydrate
      (Roitman S, Green T, Osher Y, Karni N and Joseph Levine, submitted), suggested a
      statistically significant beneficial effect of creatine augmentation to antidepressant
      treatment in resistant major depression, but possible precipitation of a manic switch in
      resistant bipolar depression (see table 1 for results). Adverse reactions were mild and
      transitory and included mild nausea and flatus.

      Ww propose to perform a double-blind, parallel, randomized add-on clinical trial of creatine
      versus placebo added to current antidepressant treatment in the treatment of major depressive
      disorder in the early phase of treatment resistant major depressive episode.

      Early phase of treatment resistant depressive episode is defined where the current treatment
      resistant depressive episode lasts no more than 6 months.

      Based on the results of the open study presented in Tab.1, we hypothesize that such study
      will show a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference between the active
      treatment (creatine) and placebo in the double blind add-on trial design proposed below.

      Study design

      This study is a parallel, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 4 weeks clinical
      trial examining the effect of creatine versus placebo added to antidepressant treatment of
      subjects with major depression demonstrating lack of adequate response to the current
      antidepressant treatment, administered in adequate dose for at least 3 weeks.

      Creatine will be purchased from Solgar LTD, Israel, where 1 tablet contains 1 gram.

      Forty consenting patients, women and men, 18 - 75 years old will be recruited. All subjects
      will have a primary diagnosis of major depression, and at the time of recruitment will be
      experiencing a major depressive episode with a duration ≥ 3 weeks and < 6 months. Subjects
      will be eligible to enter the study only if they will have a minimum score of 18 points on
      the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and are receiving conventional
      antidepressant treatment in adequate dose for at least 3 weeks with no more than mild
      improvement Blood cell count, liver and kidney functions will be performed before entering
      the study, only in patients who have not had them performed during the last 6 month prior to
      entering the study.

      Pregnant or lactating patients, those with clinically significant or unstable medical
      conditions, epilepsy, or a history of alcohol or substance abuse will be excluded from this
      study. All participants will be monitored weekly and will have a 24 hours telephone access to
      the researcher, and those who will develop suicidal or aggressive behaviors that may endanger
      themselves or others, will be immediately discontinued from the study.

      The researcher evaluating the HAM-D as well as the other study scales will be blind to the
      add-on treatment (creatine or placebo). Twenty patients will be treated with creatine add-on
      for 4 weeks (up to 10 grams).

      The other 20 patients will be receiving placebo add-on for 4 weeks. Patient's antidepressant
      treatment will not be changed during the study participation.

      Benzodiazepines are allowed, but the dose will not exceed Lorazepam equivalent dose of 4 mg
      daily.

      The following data will be recorded at the beginning of the study:

      Demographic data Psychosocial data History of hospitalizations Comorbid medical conditions
      Family history of affective disorders Previous pharmacological treatments and treatment
      response Seasonal pattern of depressive symptomatology

      The following scales will be completed at the beginning of the study and weekly thereafter
      (weeks 1 to 4):

      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24 items) Clinical Global Impression Backwards digit span
      test Scale for the assessment of side effects

      The main outcome measure will be the prediction of a sustained ≥ 50 % decrease of the
      Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) total score versus baseline ('sustained response') and the
      presence of ≥20 % HAM-D total score improvement after 1 weeks of treatment('early
      improvement')and the presence of ≥50 % HAM-D total score improvement after 1 weeks of
      treatment ('very early improvement') .

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral olanzapine is safer (fewer adverse
      events) and more effective (shorter time to sedation) than conventional haloperidol or

      1. Investigate oral use of sedating drugs within a predominantly Chinese population, to
           address this void in international literature impacting the management of acute
           agitation.

           oral olanzapine, in comparison with conventional medicines (haloperidol or diazepam) in
           a three-arm comparison for the sedation of acutely agitated patients in AEDs.
           Specifically, we aim to determine if administration of oral olanzapine (a)is more
           effective than sedation with oral haloperidol or oral diazepam alone; (b)is safer than
           sedation with comparison arms; (c)decreases the amount of subsequent redosing or
           alternative drugs required; (d)is more favourable than the haloperidol and diazepam arms
           with respect to safety, efficacy and adverse events.

      Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is a serious, life-threatening, bile acid related liver
      disease of unknown cause. Without treatment, it frequently progresses to liver fibrosis and
      eventual cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation or resulting in death. The investigational
      drug, Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a modified bile acid and FXR agonist that is derived from the
      primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid. The key mechanisms of action of OCA, including
      its choleretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties, underlie its
      hepatoprotective effects and result in attenuation of injury and improved liver function in a
      cholestatic liver disease such as PBC. The study will assess the effect of OCA compared to
      placebo, combined with stable standard care, on clinical outcomes in PBC participants.

      This Phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study is being
      undertaken at up to 170 sites internationally to evaluate the effect of OCA on clinical
      outcomes in 428 participants with PBC. The study will include a screening period of up to 8
      weeks, requiring two clinic visits. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) to
      treatment with either OCA 5 mg or matching placebo tablets, taken orally once daily for the
      majority of participants; dose and frequency will be modified for participants with cirrhosis
      and classified as Child-Pugh (CP) B or C. Randomization will be stratified by standard
      treatment with UDCA (yes/no) and baseline liver function. The treatment period involves
      clinic visits approximately every 3 months. At the 3 month visit or any study visit
      thereafter, if study treatment is tolerated, participants' dose should be titrated per
      protocol in a blinded manner eg for participants who are non-cirrhotic or classified as CP A
      and randomized to OCA, they should receive the maximum daily dose of 10 mg OCA, those on
      placebo continue to receive placebo. Subsequently, daily dosage may return to 5 mg if
      necessary for these participants who are non-cirrhotic or classified as CP A, but should be
      increased to 10 mg if possible, based on tolerability and clinical judgment. Safety and
      tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and vital signs, and blood and
      urine testing. The study is event driven and total duration will be determined by the time
      required to accrue approximately 127 primary endpoint events, estimated to be approximately
      10 years. Participants are expected to have a minimum follow-up time of approximately 6
      years.

        -  A 12-week treatment course with elbasvir/grazoprevir in ESRD GT4 treatment-naïve
           patients will result in undetectable viremia in 95% patients at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12
           (EOT) and 24 (SVR12)

        -  Treatment will be safe and well-tolerated in these patients, as determined by the type

      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE:

      Significant pain is a common condition in dying patients. Continuous subcutaneous infusion
      (CSCI) of opioids is the cornerstone in treatment of pain in this last phase of life.
      Although morphine is the most frequent used opioid in this respect, its main metabolites
      start to accumulate when renal function decreases, as is frequently the case in dying
      patients. The accumulation of one of these metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), is
      associated with neurotoxic adverse effects like delirium, allodynia and hyperalgesia. These
      adverse effects can highly effect the patient's comfort in the last days of life. The central
      effects of circulating metabolites of oxycodone, on the other hand, are negligible. On
      theoretical considerations CSCI of oxycodone for the treatment of pain in dying patients with
      a diminished renal function should therefore result in a reduced occurrence of the neurotoxic
      adverse effects delirium and allodynia/hyperalgesia in comparison to morphine. However,
      studies of sufficient quality investigating the clinical effect of this hypothesis are
      lacking at the moment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The objective of this study is to investigate whether and to what extent the occurrence of
      the neurotoxic adverse effects delirium and allodynia/hyperalgesia differs between morphine
      and oxycodone, administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI), for the treatment of
      pain in dying patients with a diminished renal function.

      Primary Objective: To compare the prevalence of delirium between oxycodone and morphine,
      administered by CSCI, for the treatment of pain in dying patients with a diminished renal
      function.

      Secondary Objective: To compare the prevalence of allodynia/hyperalgesia between oxycodone
      and morphine, administered by CSCI, for the treatment of pain in dying patients with a
      diminished renal function.

      Hypothesis: CSCI of oxycodone for treatment of pain in dying patients with a diminished renal
      function results in a reduced occurrence of the neurotoxic adverse effects delirium and
      allodynia/hyperalgesia in comparison to morphine.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      An intervention study, designed as a randomized, controlled, observer blinded, multicenter,
      superiority trial (RCT) with two parallel groups of either CSCI with morphine or oxycodone,
      with an 1:1-allocation-ratio. The total time of follow up is from start of CSCI with the
      assigned opioid until death.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The study will be conducted in hospices and both somatic and psychogeriatric (PG) wards of
      nursing homes in the southern part of the Netherlands. 15 nursing homes and 1 hospice are
      participating. The total number of beds in these locations is around 875 (350 somatic beds,
      519 PG beds and 6 hospice beds), dived over 54 wards (24 somatic wards, 29 PG wards, 1
      hospice). In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an adult subject must be in
      the dying phase, i.e. death in the near future is expected by the treating physician, and
      start of CSCI with an opioid for the treatment of pain must be indicated by the treating
      physician.

      STUDY PROCEDURE:

      After written informed consent has been obtained, randomization between CSCI with morphine or
      oxycodone is performed. Outcome measures will be gathered 3 times a week until death of the
      participant. A venipuncture for the purpose of the determining the actual renal function at
      baseline is performed at the first visit. Two weeks after a participant's death, and only
      when a separate written informed consent has been obtained, a significant other or legal
      representative will be contacted for an interview in which the perceived quality of dying is
      assessed by using the Dutch translation of the Quality of Dying and Death (QoDD)
      Questionnaire.

      Randomization: In order to prevent an uneven distribution of relevant prognostic factors,
      allocation will be stratified by means of minimisation for type of ward (somatic or
      psychogeriatric, representing absence or presence of a clinical relevant stage of dementia
      and thereby indirectly also status of mental and communicative capabilities) and for presence
      or absence of opioid use at baseline.

      Sample size calculation: Sample size calculation is based on a two-tailed test. Based on the
      available literature, the percentage of delirium in terminal patients is estimated at 86%. A
      difference of 15% is considered to be clinically relevant. The probability of a type 1 error
      is fixed at 5%. Groups are analyzed according to the intention to treat principle. In order
      to achieve a power of 80% for detecting a clinically relevant difference, 117 patients per
      group are needed.

      - Statistical analysis: All analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat
      principle. Imputation techniques will be used for supplementation of incomplete data, thereby
      guaranteeing analysis of all participants in the group they were assigned to by
      randomization. The method we will use will depend on the proportion of missing values and on
      the assumptions that can be made about the missingness mechanism after collection of the
      data: In case the percentage of incomplete cases is less than, or equal to, 5%, we will use
      single stochastic imputation to impute the dataset, as the difference in precision due to not
      taking between-imputation variance into account is likely to be negligible. If the proportion
      of incomplete records exceeds 5%, multiple imputation will be used. In that case, the number
      of imputations will be set to 10. For both imputation strategies, the imputed values will be
      drawn using predictive mean matching with a fully conditionally specified model. If, after
      collection of the data, we expect that data are missing not at random, we will impute using a
      missing not at random mechanism (again, using single or multiple imputation), and perform a
      sensitivity analysis to see whether our conclusions are robust.

      ETHICS:

      The study will be conducted according to the principles of the 7th Declaration of Helsinki
      (Fortaleza 2013) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act.
      Written informed consent has to be obtained before participation for all participants.
      Monitoring will be performed by an independent institution which follows the international
      ICH-GCP guidelines.

      Data will be entered in electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs), employing data entry
      validation. This electronic data management system is hosted by an external institution and
      complies with all applicable regulations regarding data security. Only authorized members of
      the research staff involved in the study will have access to the system. A full audit trail
      will be kept. Data storage is secured by regular back-ups by the hosting institution. Data
      will be stored for 15 years.

      No identifiable reference to subjects will be made in analysis, reports or publications. To
      protect the confidentiality of subjects, all data will only be linked to a subject by a
      numeric identification code, of which the key will be safeguarded by the investigator. Blood
      samples for determining the eGFR will be destroyed by the laboratory after 1 week and will
      not be used for any other purpose than described in the study protocol.

      An interim analysis will be performed for the primary and secondary study parameters after
      the end of follow up, i.e. death, of the first 30 participants in each group. A difference
      between the intervention and control group of more than 50% for the primary study parameter
      is considered to be an indication that one of the groups is significantly harmed more than
      the other. When this difference can't be contributed to other factors, like an uneven
      distribution of baseline characteristics, especially other medication use, it is considered
      unethical to withhold one of the groups from the superiority of one of the opioids.
      Therefore, this potential situation is regarded as a stopping rule.

      Objection by incapacitated subjects: Since the major part of dying patients experiences a
      decline in cognitive functions and are not able to respond adequately anymore, it is
      essential that this incapacitated population is not being excluded in our study. When a
      participant is or has become incapacitated, his or her legal representative decides whether
      the subject will be participating in the study or not, unless the subject previously has
      stated explicitly otherwise. Signs of consistent objection or resistance to any of the study
      procedures after inclusion have to be considered as an expression of the participant's wish
      to not participate in the study any longer. Consequently he or she will be withdrawn from the
      study immediately. In case a incapacitated participant shows signs of objection or resistance
      to the continuous subcutaneous route of administration (for example by removal of the
      infusion tube or needle) the treating physician will decide whether continuation of CSCI of
      an opioid is a medical necessity to avoid severe suffering from pain. When there is no
      medical necessity or when adequate pain control can be achieved otherwise, it is not allowed
      for the subject to participate in the study any longer and he/she will be withdrawn from the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  minimal age of 18 years at the time of inclusion;

          -  the subject is in the terminal phase, i.e. death in the near future is expected by the
             treating physician;

          -  start of CSCI with an opioid for treatment of pain is indicated by the treating
             physician;

          -  willingness to allow one-time blood collection for assessment of renal function
             (eGFR);

          -  a signed informed consent is given by the participant or his/her legal representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  delirium at the time of inclusion;

          -  opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH) at the time of inclusion;

          -  a medical necessity to apply a different opioid than morphine or oxycodone, such as
             previously demonstrated non-response to morphine or oxycodone (defined as a complete
             absence of any pain reduction after appropriate dosage), previously demonstrated
             unacceptable side effects of morphine or oxycodone, or a medical indication for an
             opioid with NMDA-receptor-antagonistic properties (currently only known for
             methadone);

          -  a documented allergy for morphine or oxycodone.

        Subjects with an eGFR >50 ml/min/1.73m2 should not be included in the study, because
        accumulation of metabolites is considered to be irrelevant in this range of renal
        functions. Despite this fact, we cannot formulate an unaffected renal function as an
        exclusion criterion prior to allocation, because the time needed for assessment of the
        renal function could lead to either an unethical delay in treatment of pain or occurrence
        of death even before the lab results are known. Therefore renal function is assessed after
        inclusion. In case a subject turns out to exceed the threshold of 50 ml/min/1.73m2, this
        will be considered as meeting an extended exclusion criterion and the subject concerned
        will be replaced by a new subject.

      Background: Innovation: Over 150,000 soldiers are currently deployed in Iraq as part of
      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and 12% of returning OIF veterans have posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Research from our group and others showed lasting neurobiological
      consequences of PTSD, including increased amygdala function and decreased medial prefrontal
      function, verbal declarative memory problems, and smaller hippocampal volume that reverses
      with treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine or the anticonvulsant
      phenytoin. Recently we found that three months of treatment with paroxetine in PTSD patients
      resulted in an increase in hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal
      integrity, as well as decreased brain metabolism in the amygdala and a reversal or stress
      induced decreases in medial prefrontal function. Subjects treated with placebo did not have
      an increase in NAA, however subsequent treatment for three months with open label paroxetine
      resulted in an increase in NAA to the level seen in the subjects treated with paroxetine in
      the double-blind phase. Paroxetine was associated with a decrease in amygdala metabolism
      measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and increased medial prefrontal function.
      Intervening soon after the trauma is critical for long-term outcomes, since with time
      traumatic memories become indelible and resistant to treatment. Diminished efficacy of
      treatment over time is shown by the fact that trials of Vietnam veterans have shown less
      efficacy over the years. Animal studies show that pretreatment before stress with
      antidepressants reduces chronic behavioral deficits related to stress; although for ethical
      and other reasons no studies have provided pretreatment before trauma exposure in humans. In
      our current VA Merit funded program we are looking at the effects of early interventions for
      Iraq soldiers with paroxetine, looking at chronicity of PTSD, cognition, cortisol response to
      stress, hippocampal volume and NAA, as outcomes. We now propose to add measurement of neural
      correlates of paroxetine response using PET.

      Objectives/Hypotheses: The objectives of this research are to:

        -  Assess the efficacy of paroxetine versus placebo in the treatment of early PTSD in OIF
           veterans

        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine versus placebo on amygdala metabolism and medial
           prefrontal response to stress in OIF veterans with PTSD.

        -  Assess the ability of brain imaging to predict treatment response and to identify
           veterans with early PTSD who will benefit from early interventions.

      Hypotheses are that paroxetine will be associated with: 1) an improvement in PTSD symptoms
      compared to placebo based on the change in the CAPS from baseline to three months of
      treatment in veterans of OIF; 2) increased medial prefrontal function and decreased amygdala
      metabolism in veterans of OIF.

      Specific Aims:

        -  Compare paroxetine to placebo in the treatment of early PTSD in OIF veterans

        -  Measure amygdala metabolism and medial prefrontal response to stress with PET in OIF
           veterans with PTSD before and after paroxetine or placebo treatment.

      Study Design: Subjects returning from Iraq who meet criteria for early PTSD (N=160) will be
      included in the study with a recruitment goal of 144 completers. A group of 80 healthy
      subjects with a history of military service during the period of OIF without a history of
      deployment and without PTSD and 80 healthy subjects with a history of deployment without PTSD
      will serve as comparator groups. All subjects will undergo baseline imaging of the brain with
      PET FDG and with measurement of brain blood flow during a memory task and with exposure to
      trauma related reminders (slides and sounds) and MRI and baseline psychometric assessments,
      following which PTSD subjects will be randomized to receive paroxetine or placebo for three
      months, with repeat imaging and assessments. After this PTSD subjects will be treated with
      three months of open label paroxetine, followed by a repeat of imaging and assessments. This
      will be an intent to treat analysis, therefore all subjects who were randomized and took at
      least one dose of study medication will be assessed at three months, regardless of whether
      they were able to stay on study medication. This will complement our currently VA Clinical
      Trial Merit funded application to measure hippocampal volume, NAA, and cortisol response to
      stress before and after early intervention with paroxetine in returning Iraq vets with early
      PTSD.

      Each enrolled patient will be given verbal and written (printed and/or electronic format)
      instructions about narcotic medication by the nursing staff upon hospital discharge. The
      instructions will explain when to use such medications, how to taper off them, and how to
      document them. Following discharge, patients will record their opioid consumption on their
      own and document their pain, nausea, sleep and satisfaction. At the first post-operative
      appointment, patients' levels of opioid use will be recorded and actual tablets consumed
      compared with prescription received. If they receive a new prescription they will receive a
      matching diary for the total length of planned opioid treatment, including directions on how
      to wean themselves off the opioids. Outcome measures will be collected at both post-operative
      visits, the first a week after surgery and the second 2-3 months following. Additional data

      decrease some problem behaviors and irritability in this particular ASD population. The
      second aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerability of oral Glutathione. The proposed

           hand. Scores range from 0 to 26 with a higher score reflecting increased severity.

        3. The DASH is a 30 item tool with each scored 1 to 5. Scores can range from 0 to 150 and

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if perioperative glucocorticoid
      administration (IV intra-operative followed by a post-operative oral taper course) improves
      post-operative range of motion in a patient population that has sustained an intra-articular
      elbow fracture(s) (radial head, proximal ulna, distal humerus, or combined) that required
      operative fixation.
    ",Steroid Administration for Articular Fractures of the Elbow (SAFE Trial),Elbow Fracture,"['Fractures, Bone', 'Elbow Fractures', 'Intra-Articular Fractures']","
      Elbow fractures are complex injuries that often involve the articular surface, are in close
      proximity to critical neurovascular structures, and are prone to post-operative
      complications. Complications following treatment of intra-articular elbow pathology can
      affect over 50% of patients and up to 30% of all patients will require a re-operation. One of
      the most common complications is joint stiffness.1 When a flexion arc of motion is diminished
      to less than 100 degrees, a flexion contracture is present greater than 30 degrees, or
      forearm rotation is less than 100 degrees, functional limitations are frequently present and
      further treatment may be recommended.2,3 In fact, contracture release may be required in
      12-20% of patients after intra-articular elbow fractures and carries a relatively high
      complication rate when performed.

      The relationship of post-traumatic elbow contracture to intra-articular fractures is well
      established and can caused by extrinsic factors such as heterotopic ossification (HO),
      fibrosis and capsular thickening, or by intrinsic factors such as failure of nonunion,
      malunion, arthrosis, or loose bodies.2,4 Recent studies analyzing the acute phase synovial
      fluid cytokine profile after an intra-articular elbow fracture have shown proinflammatory and
      catabolic factors in high concentrations that can lead to contracture through myofibroblast
      differentiation and proliferation.4 Furthermore, HO can limit range of motion in up to 40% of
      fractures and may also result from prolonged inflammation with elevated IL-1β and TNF-α
      levels.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if perioperative glucocorticoid administration (IV
      intra-operative followed by a post-operative oral taper course) improves post-operative range
      of motion in a patient population that has sustained an intra-articular elbow fracture(s)
      (radial head, proximal ulna, distal humerus, or combined) that required operative fixation.

      Primary Study Questions

        1. For adult patients (>18yo) who sustain intra-articular elbow fractures (radial head,
           proximal ulna, distal humerus, or combined) that undergo operative fixation, does
           perioperative glucocorticoid administration (IV intra-operative followed by a
           post-operative oral taper course) improve post-operative range of motion
           (flexion/extension and pronation/supination) compared to a placebo?

           Secondary Study Questions

      Anxiety is a serious medical condition that worsens quality of life by negatively affecting
      peoples thoughts, feelings, and ability to function normally. Anxiety can affect anyone, but
      people with Parkinson's appear to be at a much higher risk with an estimated 40% or more
      suffering from anxiety. Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that causes tremor and other
      problems with normal movements. The disease symptoms are believed to be caused in large part
      by the loss of dopamine producing cells in the midbrain. Anxiety in Parkinson's may be
      associated with the loss of dopamine caused by the disease and therefore may respond to
      dopamine based treatments. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the rotigotine
      transdermal patch, a dopamine replacement medication, in reducing symptoms of anxiety in
      people with Parkinson's disease.

      rotigotine or a placebo patch for 8-weeks. All participants will be evaluated at the study

      Burn-related pain is severe and often difficult to manage. Healthcare workers struggle with
      keeping burn patients comfortable, especially when these patients undergo dressing changes of
      their burn wounds of their skin since these procedures often cause severe pain. Patients with
      burn wounds frequently require high doses of opioids (narcotics) and calming (anxiolytic)
      agents to the extent that clinicians must weigh the risks associated with these doses against
      achieving adequate analgesia and comfort. The biggest risk is over-sedation to cause
      breathing troubles. Inadequate pain control during these procedures heightens pain
      perception, anxiety, and fear surrounding the experience and may lead to patients
      experiencing additional psychological disorders like depression, acute stress disorder (ASD),
      and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, therapeutic options for better
      management of pain and anxiety during these procedures need to be identified.

      This study will address whether the addition of ketamine during dressing changes improves
      patients' pain control and comfort and whether this leads to favorable psychological
      outcomes. The study is designed to compare ketamine with placebo when they are added to usual
      care (opioids and anxiolytics) during dressing changes. The main outcomes of the study will
      be the amount of opioid and anxiolytic agents each group receives during their procedure; the
      presence of pain-related anxiety shortly after the procedures; blood markers of stress during
      the procedures; and the presence of depression, anxiety and stress disorders prior to
      discharge. This study will assess whether the early administration of ketamine reduces pain
      and anxiety to prevent the need for high doses of opioids and anxiolytics. A total of 30
      patients will be enrolled.
    ","A Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Placebo vs. Ketamine For Use During Dressing Changes in Critically Ill Burn Patients","['Thermal Hyperalgesia', 'Anxiety', 'Pain']",Hyperalgesia,"
      Research Methods

      A. Outcome Measure(s):

      This is a randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ketamine
      versus placebo in addition to usual care used during dressing changes in 30 thermally injured
      subjects. The primary outcomes are the opioid and benzodiazepine requirements surrounding
      dressing changes, pain profiles, hemodynamic changes, and pain-related anxiety scores related
      to ketamine use versus placebo. Secondary outcomes are exploratory and will evaluate the
      inflammatory markers, IL-1β and IL-6, and their presence in regards to ketamine versus
      placebo as well as their associations with ASD, depression, and PTSD.

      B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:

      The study methodology will follow the CONSORT guidelines. A total of 30 critically ill burn
      patients with a total body surface area (TBSA) ≥ 5% requiring dressing changes that will be
      performed in the hydro procedure room will be enrolled over 18-24 months from the 9-bed
      burn-trauma ICU (B-TICU) at the UCH. Patients will only be enrolled if they can receive
      dressing changes in the burn treatment room because these patients are alert and oriented,
      not sedated, and are able to communicate with health care providers and respond to questions
      regarding their perceptions of pain and anxiety. Subjects will be randomized in a
      double-blind manner to receive placebo (n=15) or ketamine (n=15) in addition to usual care
      used before, during, and after dressing changes.

      C. Assessment of Outcomes

      Primary Hypothesis 1: Adjunctive ketamine safely reduces short-term pain and anxiety
      surrounding dressing change events in conscious thermally injured patients compared to usual
      care.

      Aim 1a: Comparatively evaluate the opioid and benzodiazepine requirements before, during, and
      after dressing changes between placebo and ketamine.

      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, the subject's
      active medication list will be evaluated for analgesic, anxiolytic, and neuropathic
      medications. Every hour, starting 4 hours prior to the beginning of the dressing change
      procedure, each drug, dose, and route will be recorded for administered medications. Opioid
      medications will be converted to fentanyl equivalents and benzodiazepine medications will be
      converted to midazolam equivalents as fentanyl and midazolam represent the most commonly
      administered agents. Documentation will continue every hour up to 4 hours after the end of
      the procedure. This will be repeated for every dressing change.

      Aim 1b: Comparatively evaluate patients' perceived pain levels before, during, and after
      dressing changes between placebo and ketamine.

      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, the subject
      will be asked to rate their pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) [anchored by 0
      representing no pain and 10 being the worst pain the patient has ever experienced]. The VAS
      instrument will be administered by the investigator or designee within 4-12 hours prior to
      the dressing change procedure. Subjects will then be asked to rate their pain using the VAS
      within 4-12 hours after the end of the procedure. This will be repeated for every dressing
      change.

      Aim 1c: Comparatively evaluate patients' pain-related anxiety surrounding dressing changes
      between placebo and ketamine.

      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, the subject
      will be asked to rate their pain-related anxiety score using the Burn Specific Pain Anxiety
      Scale (BSPAS). The BSPAS instrument will be administered by the investigator or designee
      within 4-12 hours prior to the dressing change procedure. Subjects will then be asked to rate
      their pain-related anxiety score using BSPAS again within 4-12 hours after the end of the
      procedure. The BSPAS is a 5-item assessment with questions relating to: feeling of worry,
      emotions surrounding dressing changes, anticipation or anxiety related to pain surrounding
      procedures, and feelings of being ""on edge"" due to experiencing pain. Each question is scored
      on a visual analog line starting at 0 and ends at 100, two anchors of reference for the
      subject. This tool was designed to detect anticipatory anxiety in burn patients and has been
      used in studies with the ability to distinguish acute anxiety in burn patients related to
      dressing changes. This will be repeated for every dressing change.

      Aim 1d: Comparatively evaluate the occurrence of hypo- or hypertension, tachycardia,
      neurologic agitation / disassociation, over-sedation, and the need for open-label ketamine
      between placebo and ketamine.

      Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored hourly for four hours before, during, and
      after the end of the procedure. Hypotension will be defined as a systolic blood pressure ≤90
      mmHg or a decrease of systolic blood pressure of ≥40 mmHg, hypertension will be defined as a
      systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg or an increase of systolic blood pressure of ≥40 mmHg, and
      tachycardia is defined as a heart rate ≥120 beats/minute or an increase of ≥20 beats/minutes.
      The administration of fluid boluses or vasopressor therapy will also be recorded. It is
      anticipated that these therapies will not be required. The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale
      (RASS) score will be used to determine neurologic disassociation (RASS score of +2 to +4
      indicating agitation or combative) and over-sedation (RASS score of -3 to -5 indicating
      moderate to deep sedation). The RASS score is performed as routine care every hour and it
      will be recorded for four hours before and after the end of the procedure. Open label
      ketamine may be administered by the burn ICU physician if patients have received both doses
      of study drug and subjects report pain scores of ≥7 (out of 10) despite the administration of
      ≥400 mcg fentanyl equivalents (this represents the 75th percentile of fentanyl required in
      the medication usage evaluations conducted at UCH) or a RASS score of -4 to -5, indicating
      levels of sedation deep enough to warrant caution against administering additional doses of
      opioids or anxiolytics. The use of open label ketamine will be recorded and comparatively
      assessed.

      Secondary Hypothesis 2: Adjunctive ketamine administration alters cytokine levels,
      specifically interleukins IL-1β and IL-6, during dressing changes compared to usual care.

      Aim 2a: Comparatively evaluate the magnitude of change in serum concentrations of IL-1β and
      IL-6 levels during dressing changes between placebo and ketamine.

      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, venous blood
      samples of 10 mL will be obtained from an indwelling catheter 4-12 hours before and after the
      procedure to evaluate the level of IL-1β and IL-6 in the serum. Blood samples will be
      centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3000rpm with plasma immediately separated and stored at -80°F.
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) will be used to determine IL-1β and IL-6
      concentrations after all subjects have completed the study.

      Secondary Hypothesis 3: Ketamine when used as an adjunct during burn dressing changes reduces
      the incidence of long-term psychometric outcomes when compared to usual care.

      Aim 3a: Comparatively evaluate the incidence of ASD between placebo and ketamine after
      dressing changes.

      Within seven days of the final dressing change procedure, an investigator will facilitate the
      completion of the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Scale (SASRS). The SASRS instrument will be
      administered by the investigator or designee. The SASRS consists of 30 items. Ten questions
      are related to dissociation, six to re-experiencing of trauma, six to anxiety and increased
      arousal, six to avoidance of the trauma, and two to impairment in functioning. The questions
      can be modified to pertain to a specific event (i.e. burn dressing changes). Each question is
      scored from 0 to 5. Also, the instrument contains an additional three questions specifically
      associated to ASD. They involve an event description, how traumatic the event was, and for
      how long the subject had his or her most severe symptoms in relation to the event. In order
      to have a positive score for ASD, the subject must score a 3 or higher for at least three of
      the dissociative symptoms and at least one symptom of each of the following: re-experiencing,
      increased anxiety and arousal, avoidance, and impairment of functioning. This scale has
      demonstrated reliability and validity and has been used in burn-related studies to assess for
      ASD with positive results.

      Aim 3b: Comparatively evaluate the incidence of anxiety and depression between placebo and
      ketamine prior to hospital discharge.

      Within 3-7 days prior to the projected date of discharge, the investigator or designee will
      administer the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS instrument will be
      administered by the investigator or designee only. The HADS consists of 14 questions, seven
      for anxiety and seven for depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a cut-off
      cumulative score of 11 for both subscales indicative of anxiety or depression. This scoring
      tool has been used for 30 years, possesses excellent reliability and validity, and avoids
      reliance conditions that are also common somatic symptoms of illness such fatigue, insomnia,
      and hypersomnia.

      Aim 3c: Comparatively evaluate the incidence of PTSD between placebo and ketamine prior to
      hospital discharge.

      Within 3-7 days prior to the projected date of discharge, the investigator or designee will
      administer the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). The IES-R instrument will be
      administered by the investigator or designee only. The IES-R evaluates subjective distress
      caused by traumatic events and will be used to assess manifestations of PTSD. It is not
      diagnostic but possesses excellent reliability and validity for manifestations of PTSD. The
      IES-R has three subscales (eight items on intrusion, eight items on avoidance, and six items
      on hyperarousal). Each item is scored on a four point scale: 0 = ""not at all,"" 1 = ""a little
      bit,"" 2 = ""moderately often,"" 3 = ""quite a bit,"" and 4 = ""extremely often."" The total score
      of each subscale may be averaged and a cumulative score of 30 is indicative of the presence
      of PTSD.

      Aim 3d: Assess possible associations between the cytokine levels and ASD, anxiety,
      depression, and PTSD.

      Statistical associations between IL-1β and IL-6 values with SASRS, HADS, and IES-R will be
      investigated.

      C. Data Analysis Plan:

      A total of 30 subjects will be evaluated (15 in each study group) based on a power of 0.8 and
      a significance level of 0.05. Data obtained from medication usage evaluations at the UCH were
      used to estimate the mean and standard deviations for the change in cumulative fentanyl
      equivalent doses for the four hour period before vs. after dressing changes. Using standard
      deviations of 130mcg, 12 subjects are required in each study group to show a desired
      difference of 150mcg between groups when comparing the magnitude of change in the fentanyl
      dose before vs. after the procedure. While all dressing changes will be evaluated, it was
      assumed for this analysis that only one dressing change per subject will occur. An additional
      three subjects per study group will be enrolled to ensure a total of 24 subjects assuming an
      upper limit of 20% for a possible drop-out rate. Thirty subjects provides power of 0.8 at a
      significance level of 0.05 to detect a 50% decline in patients reporting moderate pain (by
      VAS or BSPAS) or anxiety (by SASRS) assuming the baseline rates exceed 80%.

      Mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile ranges will be determined for all
      continuous data. The primary analyses will include all randomized subjects based on intent to
      treat regardless of whether they completed the study. Additional analyses will be conducted
      based on subjects completing the protocol (i.e. those withdrawn from the study prior to
      completing the protocol or receiving open-label ketamine will be excluded) and those
      completing treatment. Statistical analysis of continuous data between groups will use the
      student T test or the Mann-Whitney U for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively.
      Statistical analyses of continuous data within a study group will use the paired student T
      test or the Wilcoxan Rank test for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively.
      Statistical analysis of proportions will use the Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test for
      parametric and nonparametric data, respectively, with appropriate corrections for small
      sample size. Pearson product or Spearman Rank Order will be used for correlation analyses of
      IL-1β or IL-6 with the results of the psychometric scoring tools. The study is designed to
      investigate the primary hypothesis and the related specific aims. All secondary hypotheses
      are exploratory to investigate consistency of data and analyses will be interpreted
      cautiously.

      SNRB, as measured by the change in pain and objective functional ability, can solicit crucial
      information regarding a patient's clinical picture and can predict a patient's outcome
      post-surgery. By using the walk test as an objective functional assessment, the aim is to
      better standardize the threshold for a positive response to SNRB.

      In summary, SNRB, despite utilized frequently in the diagnostic work-up with patients with
      lumbar radiculopathy, vary widely in their sensitivity and specificity. The reasons, as
      outlined above, are multifactorial. The proposed study aims to minimize the known limitations
      of these injections and prospectively define their positive and negative predictive value in
      a homogenous group of patients undergoing surgery for lumbar foraminal stenosis and
      radiculopathy. The design will define a threshold of response utilizing both subjective and
      objective measures and more accurately predict excellent results following surgery.

      The proposed study will identify the threshold response level that quantifies the predictive
      value of diagnostic SNRBs in patients who present with lumbar foraminal stenosis and
      radiculopathy. Specifically, the proposed study will address the question of whether there is
      a degree or length of response to SNRB, which predicts an excellent surgical outcome. The
      hypothesis is that diagnostic SNRBs, when performed correctly, are useful in localizing the
      level of involvement in LSS and improve the accuracy and efficacy of surgical intervention.
      Use of diagnostic SNRBs will thus be used to clarify the clinical picture, giving the surgeon
      the information to make the right decision to operate or not, and, in the case of operation,
      predicting the optimal level(s) for surgical intervention. In addition, the investigators
      plan to identify and fully characterize a standard threshold level and time of nerve block
      response that will optimize the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of SNRB in predicting
      surgical outcomes.

      There are over 10 million individuals with asthma using inhaled glucocorticoids (IGCs) in the
      United States. While oral GCs are recognized to have destructive skeletal effects, far less
      is known about the effects of IGCs. This gap in our knowledge is of critical importance, not
      only because of the prevalence, chronic nature and long duration of IGC use, but also because
      several studies have found that patients using IGCs are at increased risk of fracture.
      Fracture risk is greatest in postmenopausal (PM) women, in whom IGCs may augment negative
      effects of estrogen loss and aging.

      The investigators hypothesize that initiation of IGCs in IGC naïve PM women will lead to
      decreased bone formation and uncoupling of bone turnover, a potential mechanism for the
      effect of IGCs on the skeleton.

      To test our hypothesis, the investigators will perform a randomized, controlled 4 week study
      of the acute effects of commonly used doses of budesonide (360 or 720 mcg) on bone turnover
      and circulating osteoblast precursors in 60 treatment naïve, non-asthmatic, PM women. These
      studies are of high clinical significance because there are currently no guidelines regarding
      screening, prevention or treatment for osteoporosis in patients using IGCs, nor is IGC use
      taken into account when calculating fracture risk in PM women, the group at highest risk of
      fracture. High quality evidence for low volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and abnormal
      bone quality in PM women using IGCs has the potential to change clinical practice by
      supporting specific interventions to prevent bone loss and fractures.

      The investigators will study acute biochemical and hormonal responses over 4 weeks to
      commonly prescribed moderate and high doses of budesonide one of the most widely prescribed
      IGCs, and the preferred drug for Medicare and Medicaid. Sixty treatment naïve PM
      non-asthmatic women will be randomized to one of 3 groups (20/group): placebo, budesonide 360
      or 720 mcg/day. IGCs will be self-administered as 2 puffs twice daily. Budesonide will be
      provided as Pulmicort flexhaler. At the baseline visit, subjects will be taught proper
      technique for self-administration of the inhaled medications, including mouth rinsing after
      each dose. Since dry powder formulations will be used, spacer devices are not required. Women
      will be assessed at baseline, 1,2, and 4 weeks. This time period and schedule was chosen to
      ensure adequate time for IGCs to reach peak levels, and to assess the bone metabolic
      response. Given the 4-6 hr half-life of budesonide, steady state pharmacokinetics will be
      reached at one week. The investigators will monitor medication adherence using the inhaler's
      device counter. Visits will be conducted in the Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit. To measure
      systemic absorption, serum steroid levels will be directly measured.To assess the effects of
      IGC and dose on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, morning (AM) cortisol will be
      measured at each visit and urinary free cortisol at baseline and 4 weeks.

      Oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells.

      Statins may also inhibit fibrogenesis in cirrhotic rats. In recent years, a series of pilot
      studies have assessed the effects of simvastatin on portal hypertension and risk of variceal
      bleeding.

      Only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of statins in cirrhosis of mixed etiology and
      decompensated cirrhosis. High quality clinical trials have focused on the hemodynamic effects
      of simvastatin on portal hypertension. Evidence supporting the use of statins in a real-world
      clinical setting, and data on the effects on inflammation and generation of fibrosis in the
      liver in humans is in high demand.

      Study setting The trial will take place in university hospitals with tertiary referral from
      other hospitals, departments and general practice. Patients referred to the outpatient
      clinics or hospitalized in the Gastro Unit, Amager Hvidovre Hospital (AHH) and Department of
      Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), all Denmark are eligible
      for inclusion.

      Study Part One

      After enrolment of the first 48 participants an evaluation of the trial feasibility will
      performed on the following parameters:

      i) recruitment rates, ii) allocation of adequate resources to the trial, iii) safety for the
      participants.

      Study Part One will deliver data to conduct a pilot study on the exploratory endpoints of
      inflammation, proteomics and metabolomics.

      The substudy will apply the following methodology:

      Initial analyses of biological material are performed blinded based on studyID, without
      revealing allocation to atorvastatin or placebo.

      Comparison between groups are performed by blinded allocation, meaning that analysis are
      performed as: group A versus group B, without prior knowledge of which group received the
      active drug.

      Scientific evaluation and clinical translation of study results and data are only performed
      after revelation of which group received the active drug.

      Study Part Two

      If the steering committee find all three conditions: recruitment, resources and safety
      adequate, the trial will continue into Part Two, with enrolment up to 162 participants as
      required to balance the clinical endpoints.

      Criteria for discontinuation of intervention:

      Discontinuation of trial drug will be performed in case of:

        -  The participant withdraws informed consent.

        -  Participants reach a primary endpoint (death or liver transplantation).

        -  The participant experiences serious adverse events that cause a risk to the
           participant's life or viability.

        -  The participant develops toxicity, intolerance or allergy associated with intervention
           medication.

        -  The trial participant is admitted to hospital for other morbidity that is incompatible
           with further treatment with atorvastatin.

        -  Blinding is revealed.

        -  A trial participant will be classified as dropped out of the study if the participant
           has ingested less than 55 % of atorvastatin or placebo at days 180.

      Statistical methods Data will be analyzed as repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA).
      Independent groups will be compared using unpaired T-test or non-parametric tests depending
      on normality distribution of data. Survival analysis will be performed by Cox-regression
      analyses.

      Statistical analyses will be performed as per protocol and as intention to treat analyses.

      Missing data will not be replaced but left blank in statistical analysis. For intention to
      treat analyses on repeated measures, the last available value will be carried forward to last
      value.

      Sample Size

      Prior data may indicate that the median survival time on the control treatment is 35 months.
      If the true hazard ratio (relative risk) of control subjects relative to experimental
      subjects is 0.52, we will need to study 70 experimental subjects and 70 control subjects to
      reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with
      probability (power) 0.85. The Type I error probability associated with the test of this null
      hypothesis is 0.05.

      With an expected drop-out rate of fifteen percent, we plan to enroll in total 162
      participants in Study Part One and Two, to reach the clinical endpoint of survival.

      Auditing The trial will be approved by the Danish Authorities of Health and Medicine, and may
      be subject to auditing by this institution, independent of the sponsor and investigators.
      Investigator allows direct access to source data and documents (including patient records)
      used in the trial for monitoring, auditing and/or inspection from GCP-units and The Danish
      Medicines Agency.

      Bio bank A biobank containing blood and liver tissue is established for the trial. The bio
      bank contains both samples for planned analyses, and in case of excess material, samples will
      be stored in a bio bank for future research.

      All investigations and results derived from the bio bank for future research will serve the
      purpose of improving the life and health of patients with liver cirrhosis.

      the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), halts the onset and (particularly) the
      progression of DKD, in both type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T2DM) patients. However, despite the wide use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), a considerable amount of patients
      develop DKD (20-40%), indicating an unmet need for renoprotective therapies as DKD largely
      causes the increased mortality risk from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with
      diabetes.

      Sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively novel
      glucose-lowering drug for the treatment of T2DM as they lower plasma glucose levels by
      blocking renal glucose reabsorption. In addition, these agents exert pleiotropic actions
      beyond glucose control. As such, SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease proximal sodium reabsorption,
      reduce blood pressure, body weight and uric acid. In large trials and likely through these
      pleiotropic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for
      heart failure and reduce end stage kidney disease. At this point in time, the renoprotective
      mechanisms involved with SGLT-2 inhibition still remain speculative, though a consistent
      finding is that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce estimated eGFR after first dosing, which is
      reversible after treatment cessation. This ""dip"" indicates a renal hemodynamic phenomenon
      reminiscent of the RAS blockers and is thought to reflect a reduction in intraglomerular
      pressure.

      The mechanisms of this observation have only been partially investigated by us and others.
      From studies in peolpe with T1DM it is hypothesized that SGLT-2 inhibition increases sodium
      chloride delivery to the macula densa, which in turn augments the afferent arteriolar
      resistances, known as tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), consequently reducing glomerular
      (hyper)filtration and hydrostatic pressure. Recently a trial has been conducted in humans
      with T2DM to investigate if this also holds true in these patients. Suprisingly, this study
      showed that the renohemodynamic actions of SGLT-2 inhibition in T2DM are not due to afferent
      vasoconstriction but rather efferent vasodilation [van Bommel/van Raalte Kidney International
      2019 in press]. The investigators realized that the SGLT-2 associated dip in eGFR remains
      insufficient understood. The increase in sodium excretion following SGLT-2 inhibition peaks
      at day 2-3 after which it normalizes. It is unknown whether this drop in eGFR is related to
      this peak in sodium excretion, as the drop remains after normalization of sodium excretion.
      Therefore it might be possible that glucosuria, by inducing osmotic diuresis, is the main
      driver of the reduction in intraglomerular pressure more than sodium, since SGLT-2 inhibitors
      cause persisting glucosuria.

      Furthermore, it is known that SGLT-2 induced glucosuria and possibly sodium excretion is
      dependent of renal function and HbA1c and consequently is diminished in people with CKD or
      without T2DM. However, the renoprotective effects in T2DM are also observed in patients with
      impaired kidney function and seem statistically independent of glucose levels. Until now it
      has not been investigated whether or not the SGLT-2 induced eGFR alterations occur in people
      with CKD with or without T2DM. It is clinically relevant to understand the renal hemodynamics
      of SGLT-2 inhibitors in these populations since then it is possible to interpret the results
      from the ongoing trials in people with CKD without T2DM, such as EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD.

      Recently, potential mediators of renal arterole tone, such as adenosine, have been measured
      to gain more insight into mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitor-induced changes in renal
      hemodynamics. Adenosine is known to augment preglomerular arteriolar resistance. Adenosine
      was significantly increased after SGLT-2 inhibition, as was also observed in patients with
      type 1 diabetes. However, it can also induce postglomerular vasodilation via A2aR activation
      in the presence of RAS blockade. One study in T1DM rats has shown that increased adenosine
      generation by the macula densa in response to SGLT-2 inhibition suppresses hyperfiltration,
      as the improvements in preglomerular arteriolar resistance were abolished after adenosine
      antagonist administration. To date, this has not been investigated in T2DM humans. Therefore,
      this trial will assess TGF responses with and without adenosine blockade by caffeine.

      Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC)is a disease of unknown origin with a
      significant impact on the quality of life. Next to oral treatment with tricyclic
      antidepressants or pentosan polysulphate, intravesical treatment can be used as well. The
      purpose of this treatment is to restore the protective lining of the bladder that consists of
      glycan structures (GAG). Currently only dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is FDA approved for this.
      Several other compounds have been introduced. We want to compare a solution of chondroitin
      sulphate 2% with the standard DMSO solution. We will compare the patient perception of
      benefit,but also pain scores, quality of life and micturition diaries.
    ",Prospective Trial Comparing Intravesical Chondroitin Sulphate 2% and DMSO in the Treatment of PBS/Interstitial Cystitis,"['Painful Bladder Syndrome', 'Interstitial Cystitis']","['Cystitis', 'Cystitis, Interstitial', 'Syndrome', 'Pain']","
      A. Introduction

      Painful bladder syndrome(PBS) is a syndrome which is poorly understood. Patients usually
      report suprapubic pain related to bladder filling and also report urinary urgency and
      frequency. In a subgroup of patients, typical cystoscopic findings can be noted and this
      defines this subgroup as interstitial cystitis. (Abrams et al. 116-26) The treatment of
      PBS/IC is empirical. Bladder hydrodistension under anesthesia, tricyclic antidepressants,
      antihistaminics and intravesical DMSO instillations are the only treatment for which some
      evidence exists in the literature. More than 150 other treatment modalities have been
      described . Most of them were poorly studied. (Fall et al. 1-99) Intravesical treatment with
      DMSO has stood the test of time and is the only FDA approved intravesical treatment of
      PBS/IC. DMSO however is also used as a solvent in the chemical industry and is in fact used '
      off label' in this indication. (Erickson 333-43;Emerson and Perezmarrero A136;Perez-Marrero,
      Emerson, and Feltis 36-39) One of the theories on which intravesical treatment is based,
      claims that the glycosaminoglycan layer, which protects the urothelial cells is damaged.
      DMSO, Chondroitin sulphate, hyaluronic acid and heparin have been used to repair the GAG
      layer with variable clinical success. (Daha et al. 369-72;Daha et al. 987-90;Riedl et al.
      717-21) Chondroitin sulphate seems to be promising, but comparative data are lacking.
      (Gauruder-Burmester and Popken 355-59;Nickel et al. 56-60;Hauser et al. 2477-82;Nordling and
      van Ophoven 328-35) Assessing the outcome of such treatments is difficult. Objective
      parameters such as daytime and nighttime frequency may not always reflect the impact of the
      condition on the life of the patient.

      Patient reported outcome parameters are more frequently used to assess treatments in
      overactive bladder disease and in painful bladder research. Several validated questionnaires
      can be used to assess patients with PBS/IC. One of the most frequently used is the
      O'Leary-Sant questionnaire ( see annex 1). Next to this questionnaire the Global Response
      Assessment will be used. This is a validated 7 point Likert scale comparing the current
      status of the patient to the pre-intervention status. This scale has been used in several
      other studies on PBS/IC. (Nickel et al. 910-18;Baranowski et al. 33-36) Aim To compare the
      clinical effectiveness of intravesical chondroitin sulphate 2% ( Uracyst ™) and DMSO 50% in
      the treatment of patients with painful bladder syndrome

      B. Randomization A central randomization will be used. Participating centers will have to
      contact the trial office of the dept. of urology of the University Hospitals Leuven to
      randomize the patient to one or the other treatment, either by telephone 016/346692 or
      016/348345 or by mail elza.goossens@uzleuven.be or evelien.vankriekingen@uzleuven.be . A
      block randomization per center will be done. The randomization list was generated on a web
      application ( www.randomizer.org) to ensure an unbiased randomization schedule.

      C. Protocol of administration Patients that are enrolled in the study will receive one
      intravesical instillation of Uracyst or DMSO a week during 6 weeks. DMSO is prepared as a 50%
      solution in 50cc physiologic serum. Uracyst will be prepared by the nurse or urologist
      administering the product.

      Uracyst is delivered as a 2% sterile solution in 20cc vials. The instillation is done by a
      urethral catheterization. The catheter is withdrawn once the fluid has been instilled. The
      solution is kept in the bladder for at least 30 minutes. A simple instillation protocol is
      followed, meaning that the patient can move immediately after the instillation of the
      product. The product is eliminated by spontaneous voiding after 30 minutes.

      D. Safety Safety is assessed by monitoring adverse events at every visit. Anticipated adverse
      events are hematuria, algiuria, urinary tract infection and garlic odor ( for DMSO)…

      E. Statistics Comparison of the mean GRA by T-test will be used for the primary endpoint.
      Appropriate statistical tests will be used for the secondary variables.

      To detect a 0.75 difference on the 7 point Likert scale, with 80% power at 0.05% significance
      45 patients will be needed in each group.

      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a very rare disease, with a severe impact on the life of the
      patient and the caregiver. Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) comprises a group of genetically
      determined skin fragility disorders characterized by blistering of the skin and mucosae
      following mild mechanical trauma. There is no specific proven treatment for any form of EB,
      and the mainstay of clinical management is based on protection and avoidance of provoking
      factors. Chronic nonhealing erosions and ulcers have been treated with conventional
      split-thickness skin grafts. Alternatively some patients may benefit from the use of
      autologous or allogeneic cultured keratinocyte grafts.

      Apligraf is a living bilayered cell therapy product. Apligraf is constructed of Type I bovine
      collagen. The mechanism of action of Apligraf is still unknown. No clinical evidence of
      rejection of Apligraf was observed when placed on acute or chronic wounds. Apligraf has been
      suggested to act as a ""smart"" material for wound healing by interacting with the surrounding
      environment to promote healing. It provides components with multiple actions, interacts with
      wounds in biological and physical ways, and appears to adapt to the wound environment and
      probably produces numerous pro-healing cytokines. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the use of Apligraf for the treatment of nonhealing wounds in subjects with epidermolysis
      bullosa. Apligraf will be evaluated for efficacy and safety compared to a conventional
      nonadherent dressing. The study is a pivotal, single center, within subject controlled
      observational trial in which the rate of wound healing, recurrence of EB lesions, subject
      report of pain will be compared to wounds treated with Control treatment. Subjects between 2
      and 65 years of age, inclusive, with epidermolysis bullosa lesions will be screened for this
      study. For each subject at least two designated treatment sites will be selected. In case of
      two comparable treatment sites the most right side will receive Apligraf and the most left

      Parkinson's disease (PD) causes several non-motor autonomic symptoms including lower urinary
      tract dysfunction. Their symptoms can be managed with antimuscarinics with variable efficacy.
      Fesoterodine offers a new therapeutic molecule to target the symptoms of urinary frequency,
      urgency and nocturia in this patient population. The purpose of this protocol is to compare
      the impact of fesoterodine to placebo on urinary urgency and nocturnal sleep problems in a
      heterogeneous population of PD patients in a cross-over fashion.

      A representative number of patients with baseline overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms and
      Parkinson's disease will be recruited to receive either the active drug or placebo for the
      first phase of eight weeks. The groups will then be crossed-over during the second phase of
      eight weeks. The main outcomes assessed will be the urgency episodes on a 3-day voiding
      diary, as well as the nocturnal sleep problems will be the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale
      (PDSS).
    ",Fesoterodine on Urgency Episodes in Parkinson's Disease Population,"['Urinary Bladder, Overactive', 'Parkinson Disease']","['Parkinson Disease', 'Urinary Bladder, Overactive']","
      Study purpose and rationale:

      Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly develop lower urinary tract symptoms as their
      disease severity progresses. The most frequent symptoms are nocturia (night time urinary
      frequency), urinary frequency and urgency. (1) The effects on voiding function of levodopa
      and dopamine agonists for the treatment of motor symptoms in patients with PD are not clearly
      understood because studies conclude conflicting results. (2) Their overactive bladder (OAB)
      symptoms are primarily managed with antimuscarinics with variable efficacy, and there is
      concern for possible heightened central side-effects such as cognitive or motor deterioration
      in this patient population. (3, 4) Current standard of care for PD patients with lower
      urinary tract symptoms requires a full evaluation with history and physical exam. This is
      followed by a microscopic urinalysis, a 3-day bladder diary along with several
      questionnaires. According to their symptoms, some patients may require a non-invasive
      uroflowmetry and assessment of post void residual, while others will undergo a full
      urodynamic studies. Management of their voiding symptoms will require initial conservative
      measures and behavioral modifications (reducing caffeinated drinks and smoking cessation,
      optimizing fluid intake, weight loss) and bladder training. If this fails to improve their
      symptoms, oral pharmacotherapy will be offered with antimuscarinics or beta-3 agonists.

      The purpose of this protocol is to compare the impact of fesoterodine to placebo on urinary
      urgency and nocturnal sleep problems in a heterogeneous population of PD patients in a
      cross-over fashion. Although OAB can be effectively treated, there is compelling and
      scientifically sound methodological reasons for its use as participants in the study will not
      face additional risks of serious or irreversible harm from exposure to placebo. Placebo
      controlled trials are the most rigorous test of treatment efficacy for evaluating a medical
      therapy and will require fewer subjects than active control trials. Lastly, anticholinergic
      studies have shown to have a very large placebo effect and are only partially effective in
      treating voiding symptoms, which justifies the use of a placebo arm.

      Sample size:

      This is an initial pilot study to identify the effect size of fesoterodine treatment on
      urgency episodes in patients with PD.

      Subjects will be randomized in both groups by stratifying them according to their age group
      (younger or older than 75 years-old) and gender.

      Power analysis and sample size calculation are not relevant in this study given its
      exploratory nature. The investigators expect to recruit a total of 60 patients to complete
      the cross-over study for analysis purposes. This number is based on similar design studies,
      particularly one by Wagg et al. looking at the effects of solifenacin and oxybutynin in older
      adults with mild cognitive impairment (6). Many other similar studies with groups of subjects
      varying between 40 and 77 have demonstrated efficacy differences of anticholinergics in a
      cross-over fashion (7-9).

      Design and description of methodology:

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, parallel-group study will be
      carried out in an outpatient clinic. Subjects are assessed and included in the study if they
      are willing to participate and fit the criteria at Visit 0. They are then randomized to group
      A or B and undergo a baseline evaluation. Both groups undergo a two-week washout period
      during which they are given placebo.

      Group A subjects will be started on fesoterodine 4 mg once a day in the morning after the
      two-week washout period. They will have the option to escalate to 8 mg (2 tablets of 4 mg
      each) after 4 weeks on fesoterodine. Patients will have the option to go back to one tablet
      (i.e., 4 mg) at any time in the study. At 10 weeks (2 weeks washout and 8 weeks of study
      tablets), subjects are assessed in the clinic (Visit 1).

      Group B subjects will be started on placebo tablets, similar to fesoterodine 4 mg, and will
      have the option to escalate as well.

      All subjects then have a 2-week washout period. After the washout period, subjects will be
      crossed over to the opposite arm in which the same patterns of outcome assessment and dose
      titration were maintained. The study will conclude at 20 weeks. At the end of 20 weeks (Visit
      2), the investigators' subjects will be interviewed about any side effects, vital signs will
      be examined, adverse reactions or events monitored, and outcome measures will be documented.
      Throughout the study, the subjects will be able to drop out anytime with instructions to
      inform us of their decision and about any adverse effects. Overall, each subject will have 3
      clinical visits after enrollment in the study.

      Data analysis plan:

      The comparison between the 2 arms of the study, the group that initially received
      fesoterodine with the one that received placebo, will be conducted using chi-square analysis.
      A 2-sample t test will be used to compare baseline scores between the 2 groups. The Wilcoxon
      rank-sum test will be used to calculate whether the mean difference of all the outcome
      measures between treatment and placebo periods is significant.

      Differences between placebo and treatments will be adjusted by baseline measures (where
      available and a 1-sample sign rank tested that the mean difference equated to 0). Any
      difference will be analyzed as a change from the baseline.

      The primary outcome measure will be the number of urgency episodes, with a P value less than
      .05 considered statistically significant. The present statistical analysis of secondary
      measures encompasses a number of formal comparisons, and thus a group-wise type I error could
      occur.

      Recruitment procedures:

      Study investigators will send a letter to colleagues asking for referrals of eligible
      patients interested in the study. The study investigators may provide the referring
      physicians an information sheet about the study to give to the patients. If interested, the
      patient will contact the investigator. Or, with documented permission from the patient (e.g.,
      note in medical record indicates primary care provider spoke with patient who agreed to be
      contacted), the investigaor may be allowed to contact patients about enrollment.

      Clinics maintain a separate CHR-approved recruitment protocol that asks patients if they will
      agree ahead of time to be contacted for research. Investigators contact patients about the
      study in accord with their signed consent. The investigators will consider recruitment when
      patients with PD present to their clinic with urination symptoms. They will be presented with
      the option and if they agree, they will then be assessed for inclusion. The investigators
      will be blinded to the treatment group.

      Details on confidentiality:

      All data will remain confidential and will be available for access by the investigators only.
      All records will be identified with a unique identifier, corresponding to the subjects, to
      maintain confidentiality. Records will be kept in one safe and locked location, and
      electronic records will be password protected. The study information will be kept for
      duration of 25 years.

      As this is an investigator-initiated trial, Pfizer Canada's role is restricted to providing
      the medications and placebo, as well as the budget required to do the study. They have
      approved the current protocol, and will not be involved in further decision-making or data
      analysis. There are no other potential conflicts of interest.

      Statement on ethical considerations:

      The study will be conducted according to ethical principles stated in the Declaration of
      Helsinki (2013), ethics approval will be obtained before initiating study-related procedures,
      consent forms will take into consideration the well-being, free-will and respect of the
      participants, including respect of privacy.

      This study will attempt to learn how to better treat trauma patients with delirium who are on
      a breathing machine. Delirium, also known as acute, temporary brain dysfunction, is a common
      reason why ventilated patients can not be weaned from the breathing machine even though their
      lungs may be healthy enough to breathe without the machine. The study hopes to show that by
      decreasing the patient's delirium it will lead to quicker weaning from the breathing machine
      and possibly a quicker overall recovery as well. Patients enrolled in this study will be
      treated with Clonidine or placebo. Clonidine is a drug that produces significant calming
      effects, decreases anxiety, and reduces pain, but with a lower incidence of delirium than
      other medications used in the ICU for this purpose. Clonidine is not approved by the Federal
      Food and Drug Administration for treatment of delirium, but is commonly used for this
      purpose.
    ",Use of Transdermal Clonidine in Trauma Patients,Delirium,Delirium,"
      Obtaining the appropriate level of sedation and analgesia in severely injured trauma patients
      admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to the diversity of injuries
      as well as the breadth of comorbidities present in this population. Clonidine may be a useful
      adjuvant to traditional analgesics such as opioids and sedatives such as benzodiazepines and
      propofol. Ventilator dependent trauma patients frequently fail extubation trials secondary to
      inappropriate sedation, inadequate analgesia or undertreated delirium. Patients that fail
      extubation for these reasons have a potentially preventable prolonged ventilator, ICU and
      hospital course. Ventilated trauma patients that meet criteria for our institution's SBT
      protocol and have the diagnosis of delirium will be considered for the trial if they have a
      documented failed SBT. We hypothesize treatment of this patient population with transdermal
      Clonidine will decrease delirium in trauma patients during their ICU stay. Patients enrolled
      in the treatment group will receive an oral loading dose of Clonidine 0.3 mg and placement of
      a Clonidine Transdermal system at a dose of 0.3-mg/day (Catapres TTS-3) covered by a patch
      overlay. In 12 hours the patient will receive a second and final dose of Clonidine 0.3 mg.
      The placebo group will receive a placebo oral tablet and the overlay patch only and in 12
      hours they will receive a second and final placebo tablet. A total of 120 patients will be
      enrolled, 60 patients in each group. All patients will complete the study at end of Day 14 or
      upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes sooner. Ventilator times will be measured
      in each group as well as the prevalence of delirium by the amount of positive CAM-ICU scores

      and who are covered by the Louisiana Office of Group Benefits (OGB) Health Insurance. LOSS
      will track the efficacy, safety and costs to compare two patient management approaches -
      intensive medical treatment, or a usual medical care treatment model. Recruitment will be
      done by mailers to insured patients to identify eligible candidates. We will randomly assign
      eligible volunteers to intensive medical treatment (n=240) or usual care (n=240). Patients
      will be evaluated annually and medical treatments are given in eight clinics around
      Louisiana. The eight sites are in Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Monroe,
      Hammond, New Orleans and Shreveport.

      Hypothesis:

      We hypothesize that we can achieve weight loss after two and five years that exceeds 20% from
      baseline with intensive medical management of persons with class III obesity and that this
      weight loss is greater than that achieved with usual medical care including access to a
      weight management web site.

      Our secondary hypotheses are: 1) that the weight loss at year 2 and 5 in the intensive
      medical group is associated with improvements in blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids,
      health-related quality of life and psychosocial measures and is greater improvement than that
      achieved with usual medical care and access to a website; and 2) that total medical costs in
      the intensive medical management group will compare favorably to total medical costs in the
      usual care group (i.e., total reimbursement from insurance costs will be less, even when the
      expense of the treatment is considered).

      Overall Aim:

      The overarching aim of this study is to observe the effect of an intensive medical management
      program versus usual care for class III obesity on weight loss, total medical costs and, on
      measures of health risks associated with weight loss (blood pressure, blood glucose, blood
      lipids, and health-related quality of life).

      Specific Aims:

      Primary: The primary specific aim of the LOSS study is to test the hypothesis that the weight
      loss efficacy at years 2 and 5 for an intensive medical treatment program for Class III
      obesity produces greater weight loss, as compared to a condition of usual care.

      Secondary: The secondary aims of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the percent change in body weight, absolute change in body weight
           (kilograms) and percent excess weight lost from baseline at months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48
           and 60 for medically treated patient groups, and at years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for both
           groups.

        -  To evaluate the number and proportion of subjects who maintain 100% and 80% of 12 months
           weight lost at months 24, 36, 48 and 60 for medically treated patients and at years 2,
           3, 4 and 5 for both groups.

        -  To evaluate the changes from baseline in blood pressure, pulse rate, and efficacy
           laboratory parameters at visits on months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 for the medically
           treated patient group, and at years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for both groups.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the intervention regimens at months 3, 6, 12,
           24, 36, 48 and 60 for the medically treated patient group.

        -  To assess the total medical costs of the participants treated with intensive medical
           treatment and for the patients receiving usual care at years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

        -  To assess additional psychosocial and economic measures (health-related quality of life,
           pain, depression, and stress) for the intervention group at months 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48
           and 60 months for both groups at years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

        -  To compare subgroups of patients with class III obesity to determine if differences in
           outcome exist for gender, race, education level, decades of age and presence of
           co-morbid conditions.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of pain control by
      fentanyl, administered via adhesive skin patches, at doses of 25 to 100 micrograms per hour

    ",Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Fentanyl Delivered by Adhesive Skin Patch in Out-Patients With Chronic Cancer Pain,Pain,Cancer Pain,"
      Patients with cancer pain are frequently under-medicated with morphine. This is a 56-day
      open-label study of the efficacy and safety of self-administered fentanyl skin patches for
      cancer pain control in patients in the home-care setting not previously using morphine. The
      first 15 days of the study are for dose stabilization and the rest of the study assesses pain
      control and quality of life at stable doses of medication. The dose is determined by the
      patient with oversight by the investigator, and rescue oral morphine medication can be used
      when necessary. The patient records all medication use in a diary and fills out
      questionnaires concerning pain control, intestinal function (constipation) and overall
      quality of life. The hypothesis is that patients will be able to control their cancer pain by
      self-administering transdermal fentanyl at home and that they will well tolerate the
      medication.

    ",Does Low-does Cervical Epidural Lidocaine Cause Transient Weakness?,Cervical Radiculopathy,"['Radiculopathy', 'Asthenia']","
      Cervical radicular pain is relatively common, often treated with epidural steroid injection
      (ESI), when conservative treatments like oral analgesics, physical therapy, and activity
      modification have failed. There are no universal clinical practice guidelines for the use of
      diluents when CESI are performed.

      Interlaminar CESI may be performed with or without the use of local anesthetics, due to
      training bias or theoretical concerns of weakness. CESI without the benefit of local
      anesthetic as a steroid diluent increases the latency of pain relief and may decrease
      diagnostic information immediately after a CESI with regard to pain generators responsible
      for symptoms, and may potentially decrease patient satisfaction.

      By evaluating the effects of local anesthetic as a diluent during interlaminar cervical ESI,
      we will enhance the safety of this treatment with regard to expectations of objective motor
      weakness as well as post procedure pain control in the recovery phase after the injection
      procedure.

      Additionally, investigation of short-term pain, function, medication use, and global
      impression of change following use of local anesthetic versus saline as a diluent during
      interlaminar cervical ESI will provide evidence to inform the optimization of clinical
      outcomes related to steroid diluent choice.

      When drug resistance is detected by molecular methods such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay,
      second-line Multi Drug-Resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis treatment is started in the complete
      absence of detailed resistance information. The diagnosis of Multi Drug-Resistant
      Tuberculosis is confirmed only on availability of Line Probe Assay (LPA)/Drug Susceptibility
      Testing (DST) results. Extremely Drug-Resistant (XDR) Tuberculosis is diagnosed by in vitro
      phenotypic resistance to Rifampicin, Isoniazid, fluoroquinolones and injectable second-line
      drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Existing culture based Drug Susceptibility
      Testing provides results after 6-8 weeks. This duration may be further increased by other
      existing laboratory challenges, such as culture contamination.

      Furthermore, initial regimens are often not optimal and sometimes completely ineffective as
      there is a lack of Drug Susceptibility Testing to support them. More importantly, even
      optimal regimens are changed due to patient intolerance of the drug's side effects.

      Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has the advantage of determining the complete Deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) sequence of an organism's genome at a single time point. Using this technology,
      genotypic mutations conferring resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs can be identified. This
      information will assist in identifying not only potential resistant drugs, but also
      susceptible drugs and thus enable a more accurate and appropriate choice of regimen. In
      addition, drugs that will not add value to the treatment outcome, but will increase rates of
      adverse drug reactions, can be eliminated earlier, improving drug-resistant TB treatment
      outcomes.

      In this proposal, we aim to use Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) whole genome sequencing
      prior to the selection of a drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimen and thus provide an
      individualized treatment strategy for drug-resistant tuberculosis. By adopting this method,
      we hope to improve culture negative survival rates at 6 months post treatment initiation .

      standard of care (SOC) treatment. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will be given
      an individualized treatment regimen based on whole genome sequencing conducted on
      Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) positive sputum samples collected at the screening

      Tocolytic agents are used for the treatment of preterm labor. It is unclear whether
      combination treatments of two tocolytic agents are more effective in stopping preterm labor
      compared to one. Therefore, the investigators propose a comparative effective trial of

      The investigators current treatment for preterm labor has not been shown to be effective in
      prolonging pregnancy sufficiently to improve neonatal outcomes and other treatment strategies
      are needed. Multiple examples demonstrate that multi-agent treatments are routine clinical
      practice in other fields of medicine including chemotherapeutics for cancer,
      multi-therapeutics for myocardial infarction and broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. At
      this time, it is unclear if a combination of tocolytic medications for preterm labor is more
      advantageous for women. If pregnancy is prolonged with combined tocolytic therapy, this could
      directly influence the treatment of preterm labor and potentially improve neonatal outcomes.
      There currently are no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents,
      such as nifedipine and indomethacin. Thus, we propose a comparative effective trial of
      nifedipine plus indomethacin vs. nifedipine alone for the treatment of preterm labor

      Pain has been recognized to be the most common and predictable side effect of medication
      abortion, causing significant distress associated with the process. Yet there is little known
      about the appropriate management of pain during this process, with no current evidence based
      recommendations for optimal analgesic regimens during the first trimester.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral methadone for pain control during
      medication abortion. The current medication regimen used to perform medication abortion is a
      dose of mifepristone (antiprogesterone) orally, followed by a dose of misoprostol
      (prostaglandin analogue) 24 to 72 hours later. Patients are prescribed a standard dose of
      ibuprofen 600-800mg tabs for pain control during the process. The investigators will conduct

      loss and development of supersensitivity psychosis, might outweigh their benefits. Thus, the
      current standard of long-term maintenance antipsychotic treatment, which has the primary goal
      of relapse prevention, has to be questioned. Here the investigators hypothesize that
      intermittent treatment (experimental) with antipsychotics, which is directed exclusively
      against the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia, is associated with less loss in total grey
      matter volume than maintenance treatment (control). Furthermore, the investigators
      hypothesise that this targeted treatment approach is associated with better functional
      outcome (fewer negative symptoms, better cognitive performance, better quality of life) than
      continuous antipsychotic treatment,although the latter is initially associated with fewer
      relapses.The aim of the present study is to compare two different drug therapies -maintenance
      therapy versus on-demand, intermittent therapy- in terms of their treatment's success and the
      structural changes in the brain.
    ",Antipsychotic Induced Structural and Functional Brain Changes,Schizophrenia,Schizophrenia,"
      Patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-5 admitted to a hospital
      participating in the consortium will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as soon as
      possible after admission. Ideally, this procedure is performed before initiation of
      antipsychotic treatment (benzodiazepines are allowed). If not possible for clinical reasons,
      antipsychotic treatment will be started and the MRI will be acquired within three days of
      initiation of drug treatment. The choice of the antipsychotic will be made by the treating
      physician. All approved antipsychotics are permitted, including first-generation
      antipsychotics such as haloperidol or flupenthixol. This is based on the recommendation of
      the British NICE guidelines: ""In nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of
      1,801 participants with first-episode or early schizophrenia (including people with a recent
      onset of schizophrenia and people who have never been treated with antipsychotic medication),
      the evidence suggested there were no clinically significant differences in efficacy between
      the antipsychotic drugs examined."" (NICE 2009, p. 105). However, since second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGA) are now considered first-line treatment for schizophrenia according to
      the German S3 guideline, it can be assumed that more than 80% of all patients will be treated
      with an SGA.

      As soon as positive symptoms are sufficiently controlled, medication will be completely
      tapered off within four weeks. Sufficient control of positive symptoms will defined as
      follows: ""delusions"" (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item 1), ""hallucinatory
      behaviour"" (PANSS item 3), and ""suspiciousness/persecution"" (PANSS item 6) have to be
      ""absent"" or ""mild"" (scores 1 or 2). The PANSS Positive score (7 items) must not be above 18.
      Patients in the experimental group who will not reach remission according to this definition
      will be switched to another antipsychotic according to clinical standards. Tapering of
      medication might be considered at a later time-point. Patients who cannot be tapered off
      medication will be treated with the lowest possible dose.

      Treatment of subsequent exacerbations / psychotic relapses will follow the same rules.

      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study will compare
      ezogabine/retigabine IR (investigator-selected daily doses of 600 milligram (mg)/day, 750
      mg/day, 900 mg/day, 1050 mg/day or 1200 mg/day) with placebo. Study drug will be taken three
      times a day (TID) in equally or unequally divided doses.

      The study design includes up to a 10-week (wk) Screening (≤2 wks)/Baseline (8 wks) Phase, a
      Titration Phase (2 wks), Dose-Optimization Phase (8 wks), Maintenance Phase (8 wks), and
      Taper/Follow-Up Phase (3 wks). The total duration of the study for each subject will be
      approximately 31 wks, and at minimum approximately 27 wks if subjects provide reliable 28-day
      retrospective seizure data.

      Approximately 280 subjects will be screened with approximately 208 subjects randomly assigned
      to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (ezogabine/retigabine IR, or placebo).

      Subjects will be instructed to start investigational product (IP) the day after the baseline
      visit. During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects will be taking 300 mg/day (100
      mg TID). During the second week, subjects will be taking 450 mg/day (150 mg/day TID).

      At the beginning of the Dose-Optimization Phase (3rd week of study drug) subjects will take
      600 mg/day (200 mg TID) for one week. Thereafter during the Dose-Optimization Phase, subjects
      will continue to increase their daily dose by 150 mg per week until they have achieved their
      optimal tolerated dose. During this phase, the investigator may choose to have the subject
      stay on his/her designated dose for another week before attempting a dose increase until
      reaching a dose of 1200 mg/day. In addition, in the context of tolerability issues, the
      subject may be reduced to the preceding dose level for one week before attempting to increase
      the dose again at the next scheduled time point until the subject reaches optimal dose.
      Subjects unable to tolerate a minimum of 600 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.

      The Maintenance Phase will begin at Week 10 (Visit 8) and will last 8 weeks. During the
      Maintenance Phase, subjects will remain on the daily TID dose achieved at the end of the
      Dose-Optimization Phase.

      Seizure type and frequency will be monitored throughout the study via a Seizure Calendar and
      will be evaluated at each study visit. Subjects will be instructed to complete the daily
      Seizure Calendar during each phase of the study.

    ",A Study to Assess Disability in Anemic Elderly Patients With Kidney Disease Receiving PROCRIT (Epoetin Alfa),"['Anemia', 'Kidney Diseases']",Kidney Diseases,"
      This is an open-label study in which PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) will be given on a weekly basis
      starting at a dose lower than is currently approved by the U.S. FDA because treatment is
      beginning at a higher hemoglobin than usual. There is recent evidence to suggest that
      problems with disability occur in persons over 65 at higher hemoglobins than previously
      recognized. Currently, PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) is prescribed for patients with chronic kidney
      disease three times a week at a dose of approximately 5,000 and 10,000 units per injection
      depending on the patient's weight. This study is starting with a lower dose because treatment
      is beginning earlier than it normally would. Currently, doctors usually do not begin PROCRIT®
      (Epoetin Alfa) in patients with chronic kidney disease until their hemoglobin is <10 g/dL.

      In this study PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) will be given on a weekly basis starting at 5,000 units
      per injection if hemoglobin is <12 g/dL. Each week hemoglobin will be checked and if after
      four weeks of treatment it is < 13 g/dL, the PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) dose will be increased
      to 10,000 Units. After another four weeks of treatment if the hemoglobin is <13 g/dL,
      PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) will be increased to 20,000 units. After another four weeks of
      treatment if the hemoglobin is <13 g/dL, PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) will be increased once more
      to a final dose of 40,000 units. In this study, patients will be treated with doses higher
      than currently approved for patients with chronic kidney disease. The primary measures of
      efficacy will be assessed using two disability tests to measure physical function compared
      from baseline to Week 5, Week 9, Week 13, Week 17/ Early Withdrawal and Week 20/Follow-up.
      The first test is called the ""Short Physical Performance Battery"" (SPP) which will test how
      well someone sits, stands and walks. The second test is called the ""Six Minute Walk Test""
      (6MWT) which measures how far someone can walk during a six-minute period. Normal walking
      aids are allowed during this test. The study will also evaluate hemoglobin levels, number of
      transfusions, safety, incidence of anti-erythropoietin antibodies, Quality of Life and
      cognitive function (a measure of how clearly one is thinking). The study hypothesis is that
      physical function will improve when the hemoglobin level is increased. Patients will receive
      PROCRIT® (Epoetin Alfa) on a weekly basis starting at 5,000 units per injection (up to a
      maximum of 40,000 units).

    ",Prevention of P. Vivax Malaria During Pregnancy in Bolivia,Malaria,"['Malaria', 'Malaria, Vivax']","
      It has been demonstrated that malaria is responsible for anaemia during pregnancy and reduces
      birth weight among newborns. In Bolivia, malaria is mostly caused by P. vivax. Maternal and
      foetal consequences of P. vivax infections have been poorly investigated until now, over all
      in South America. In fact, recommendations for the protection of pregnant women from malaria
      in Bolivia have not been clearly established. Prophylaxis by chloroquine is still recommended
      in other continents than Africa, mainly because chloroquine resistances are still uncommon in
      P. vivax species. The alternative way to protect women during pregnancy is to treat malaria
      attacks during antenatal visits. For this purpose, we will realize a study in order to assess
      the most appropriate way to protect women and foetus from malaria infection, i.e. weekly
      prophylaxis or mild malaria attack treatment, both by chloroquine. By realizing a randomized
      and multicentric clinical trial on 800 women in each group, we will compare the impact on
      maternal malaria attack incidence rates, on proportions of mothers with anaemia, on low-birth
      weight and on positive parasitaemias during pregnancy and at delivery, of weekly prophylaxis
      and mild malaria attack diagnosis and treatment. The study will be undertaken during 18
      months in the region of Santa Cruz and will give important information to the Bolivian

      LMB (localized mild breakthrough)is one of two psoriasis adverse events commonly seen in
      efalizumab treated patients. It is generally papular in nature and does not involve existing
      lesions. Clinical experience suggests that LMB may not have a clinical impact in patients
      responding to efalizumab and therefore may be treated without interrupting efalizumab
      therapy. To relieve discomfort topical therapy may be indicated until the symptoms are
      resolved.

      This is a single arm, open label study. Fifteen patients who are receiving efalizumab before
      entrance into this study and who develop LMB wil be enrolled. Topical
      calcipotriene/betamethasone (Taclonex) will be applied to the areas (except face, axillae or

      Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress cytopathic immune responses and inhibit transplant
      rejection. Our goal is to exploit the Treg suppressive properties to induce transplantation
      tolerance. In contrast to effector T cells, Tregs constitutively express the high affinity
      IL-2 receptor, which makes them exquisitely sensitive to very low-doses of IL-2. We propose
      here to conduct a phase IV clinical trial in which we will test the capacity of low-dose IL-2
      to promote the selective expansion of endogenous Tregs in liver transplant recipients at the
      time immunosuppressive drugs are being discontinued. We expect this will promote Treg
      accumulation within the transplanted liver, shift the balance between effector T cells and
      Tregs, and facilitate the development of operational tolerance in patients unlikely to reach
      this state spontaneously. We expect the trial to start shortly after the initiation of the
      project and to provide robust evidence on the efficacy of IL-2 within 47 months.
    ",Low-dose IL-2 for Treg Expansion and Tolerance (LITE),"['Transplantation', 'Liver Diseases']",Liver Diseases,"
      Transplantation remains the most successful treatment for end-stage organ failure, but the
      need to administer life-long immunosuppression (IS) to prevent rejection limits patient
      survival. Liver transplantation is the only transplantation setting in which a sizeable
      proportion of patients spontaneously develop ""operational tolerance"", a phenomenon defined by
      the maintenance of stable graft function in the absence of destructive immune responses
      without the need of IS. Unfortunately this phenomenon preferentially develops in elderly
      recipients and several years after transplantation. To maximize the benefit derived from IS
      discontinuation there is a need to find strategies to intentionally induce tolerance in young
      recipients in whom accumulated IS toxicity has not yet occurred. Our studies have revealed
      that successful IS discontinuation is associated with a transient intra-graft immune
      regulatory response with preferential accumulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). This
      suggests that short-term enhancement of Treg numbers and/or function at the time of IS
      withdrawal may facilitate the acquisition of tolerance in patients who are not predisposed to
      spontaneously develop it. IL-2 is a cytokine that is essential for the optimal development,
      survival and function of Tregs. Several clinical studies have shown that low-dose IL-2
      preferentially expands Tregs and is safe and efficacious in patients with autoimmunity or
      GVHD. In these studies, Treg frequency increased up to 2 to 8-fold without significant
      changes in the number of effector T cells. Our objective is to investigate if administration
      of a short-course of low dose IL-2 to liver transplant recipients facilitates the
      discontinuation of IS. We propose to conduct a phase II, safety and efficacy, prospective,
      single-arm clinical trial in which liver recipients <50 years old and 2-6 years after
      transplantation will receive IL-2 and gradually discontinue their IS medication.

      insomnia defined as the coexistence of comorbid insomnia ans OSA is a frequent diagnosis in
      military personnel with combat exposure. Similar to prior reports of patients with OSA
      without PTSD, comorbid insomnia can create a barrier to CPAP therapy. Ramelteon (TAK-375),
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of insomnia with sleep onset
      abnormalities, is a neurohormone that functions as a melatonin receptor agonist targeting the
      MT1 and MT2 receptors located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus which
      regulates the circadian rhythm of the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.The goal is to test the
      hypothesis that the administration of insomnia therapy-ramelteon- significantly improves
      treatment outcomes in Veterans with PTSD and complex insomnia compared with placebo.

      Direct acting antivirals (DAA) are new medications that have been approved for the management
      of HCV. These drugs have proven to be very effective in curing the HCV, without the need for
      interferon injections; which have always been used in the past. There are many combinations
      of DAAs, which treat specific types of HCV. Persons who test positive for the virus are
      typically referred to be seen and treated by a specialist hepatitis service based in
      hospital. This means that individuals may sometimes not attend the hospital to commence
      treatment; or follow up on their management.

      The study is designed as a cluster-randomized trial in the setting of a meningitis epidemic
      to assess the impact of chemoprophylaxis with single-dose ciprofloxacin on the incidence of
      meningitis in the study area.

      The study will be implemented in a health district in Niger where a meningitis outbreak is
      occurring, and where Médecins Sans Frontières is providing assistance to the Ministry of
      Health in its outbreak response. In order to launch the study protocol, at least two Health
      Areas (HA) of a Health District (HD) will have met the weekly epidemic threshold of 10 cases
      per 100 000 per week, or of 5 cases per week if the population of the HA is less than 30 000
      people, following the most recent WHO recommendations for meningitis surveillance.

      All villages in the HAs which have crossed the epidemic threshold and are included in the
      study area will be randomized to receive standard care, household-level prophylaxis or
      community-wide prophylaxis.

      Once a HA has been included in the study, a case-based surveillance system will be put in
      place, or reinforced if one is currently in place in the study area. Suspected cases of
      meningitis that present to health posts will be referred to the nearest health center. In
      each health center, the diagnosis and treatment of meningitis will follow national protocols.

      In the standard care arm, after the first case has been notified from a village, a study
      nurse will visit the village with a local community member. The study nurse will lead an
      informational session for members of the community regarding the signs and symptoms of
      meningitis, and the urgency of presenting to the nearest health center as soon as possible if
      any of those signs or symptoms arrive. In the household-level prophylaxis arm, each time a
      case is reported from a village that has been randomized to this arm, a study nurse will
      visit the household of the notified case within 24 hours. The study nurse will offer
      ciprofloxacin to all persons currently living in the same household compound and present at
      the time of the visit. In the community-level prophylaxis arm, after the first case is
      reported from a village that has been randomized to this arm, a member of study staff will
      visit the village within 24 hours. During this visit, arrangements will be made for a
      community-wide distribution of ciprofloxacin, preferably within 72 hours of the initial case
      presentation at the health center / district hospital. A series of informational meetings
      will be organized before the distribution.

      If the epidemic is in an urban setting, neighborhoods will be randomized to one of the three
      arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. If the epidemic is in a rural area, villages will be randomized to
      either standard care or village-wide prophylaxis in a 1:1 ratio.

      A nested substudy to assess the effects of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis on the prevalence of
      ciprofloxacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae will be carried out among 400 persons (200 in the
      standard care arm and 200 in the community-wide prophylaxis arm). Participants will provide a

      Hypothesis In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, malnutrition, inflammation and
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease commonly coexist. The triad has been coined the ""MIA
      syndrome"". Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plays
      a central role in the pathogenesis of the MIA syndrome. Thalidomide selectively inhibits the
      production of TNF-alpha and represents a valuable anti-cytokine therapy.

      Specific Aim To study the effect of thalidomide in attenuating or reversing malnutrition and
      systemic inflammation in PD patients.

      Research Plan

      Design: Double-blinded randomised prospective placebo control trial. Setting: Renal unit of a
      university teaching hospital. Subjects: Sixty prevalent PD patients with evidence of
      malnutrition. Interventions: Patients will be randomised to receive either oral thalidomide
      100 mg nocte or placebo.

      Main outcome measures: Patients will be followed for 1 year. Nutritional parameters including
      serum albumin, subjective global assessment, malnutrition-inflammation score, normalised
      protein nitrogen appearance, fat-free edema-free body mass and anthropometry measurements
      will be monitored. Systemic inflammatory markers such as serum C-reactive protein and IL-6
      will be assayed. Hospitalisation, cardiovascular events, and overall patient survival will
      also be compared during study period.

      Expected Outcome

      Nutritional parameters and markers of systemic inflammation are expected to improve with
      thalidomide therapy. The magnitude of improvement in nutrition, as well as patient morbidity,
      will be compared with placebo.

      In Hong Kong, 80% of end-stage renal failure patients are treated with PD. Malnutrition,
      cardiovascular disease and systemic inflammatory response are all common in our clinical
      practice. They are major causes of patient morbidity and mortality. As a readily available
      anti-cytokine therapy, thalidomide may represent a valuable treatment of the MIA syndrome.
      The proposed study will provide important insight on the clinical benefit of thalidomide
      treatment in malnourished PD patients, which accounts for about one-third of our dialysis
      population.

           Interventions

           After initial evaluation in a screening visit at -4 week, patients will be randomly
           assigned to receive either oral thalidomide 100 mg nocte or placebo. Thalidomide will be

           accordance with the published guidelines for the clinical use and dispensing of
           thalidomide [34]. There will be 30 patients on each arm of randomization. Dialysis
           prescription will be changed only if there is clinical evidence of underdialysis. Both
           patients and investigators will be blinded from the therapy during follow up assessment.
           Side effects will be recorded and the drug will be discontinued when clinically
           necessary.

           Clinical follow up

           Patients will be followed at at -4 (screening), 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52
           weeks. The following clinical data will be documented during each visit:

           Body height and body weight Blood pressure Compliance to thalidomide by pill count
           Compliance to dialysis exchange by direct questioning Skin itchiness score from 0 to 3+,
           as described previously [31]

           Body-mass index and body surface area will be computed. The majority of patients will be
           on three or four 2-liter exchanges per day. Blood pressure or edema are controlled with
           standard anti-hypertensive agents and/or hypertonic dialysate.

           Laboratory parameters

           A full panel of biochemical parameters will be monitored:

           Hemoglobin, plasma sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphate,
           alkaline phosphatase, and alanine transaminase at -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44
           and 52 weeks Fasting serum glucose, lipid and iron profile at 0, 24 and 52 weeks Serum
           parathyroid hormone at 0 and 52 weeks Serum inflammatory markers at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52
           weeks

           Inflammatory markers include serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
           leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and fibrinogen levels, as
           suggested by other groups [35-38].

           Nutritional assessment

           Nutritional status will assessed by subjective global assessment (SGA), comprehensive
           malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS), normalized protein nitrogen appearance (NPNA),
           serum albumin level, anthropometric lean body mass (LBM), and fat-free edema-free body
           mass (FEBM).

           SGA will be performed at -4, 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks by a single observer. The 4-item
           7-point scoring system proposed by Enia et al [39] will be used. MIS will be performed
           at -4, 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks. The calculation of MIS has been described previously
           [40]. Briefly, MIS consists of 4 main parts and 10 components, all scored from 0
           (normal) to 3 (very severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 30.

           FEBM and PNA will be measured by creatinine kinetics at 0, 24 and 52 weeks. A 24-hour
           dialysate and urine collections will be performed. Total and peritoneal Kt/V are
           determined by standard methods. Residual GFR is calculated as average of 24-hour urinary
           urea and creatinine clearance. FEBM is calculated according to the formula of Forbes and
           Brunining [41]. PNA is derived from the Randerson's formula [42]. It is further
           normalized to standard body weight.

           Anthropometric measurements will be performed at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks by a single
           observer. This include bicep, tricep, subscapular and supra-iliac skin fold thickness,
           and midarm muscle circumference. Derived variables by anthropometric measurements,
           including lean body mass (LBM) and percentage of body fat, will be computed by standard
           formula [43].

           Pulse wave velocity

           Pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index of aortic stiffness, is measured using an automatic
           computerized recorder at 0, 24 and 52 weeks. The results will be analyzed by the
           Complior SP program (Artech Medical, France). Briefly, pressure-sensitive transducers
           are placed over the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery) and groin (femoral
           artery) with the patient in the supine position on day of haemodialysis treatment before
           putting patient to the dialysis machine. PWV of the carotid-femoral and carotid-radial
           territory is calculated by dividing the distance between the sensors by the time
           corresponding to the period separating the start of the rising phase of the carotid
           pulse wave and that of the femoral and also the radial pulse waves. The procedure takes
           10 to15 seconds to complete. The test will be performed by the same observer to
           eliminate effect of intra-observer variation.

           Health-related quality of life

           Patient acceptance and satisfaction will be assessed by the Chinese translation of
           ""Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SFTM), version 1.3"", at 0 and 52
           weeks.

           Outcome

           The major outcome measure is nutritional status, as detailed above. The schedule of
           various tests is summarized in Appendix 2. Secondary outcomes include the followings:

           Change in arterial pulse wave velocity Total number of days of hospital admission during
           study period Composite cardiovascular end point: cardiovascular death, non-fatal
           myocardial infarction or stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, coronary
           intervention, transient ischemic attack, or lower limb ischemia Number of episode of
           peritonitis during study period All cause mortality

           Transplantation, conversion to hemodialysis, recovery of renal function, and transfer
           out of the unit will also be recorded.

        4. Potential Outcomes

      In Hong Kong, 80% of end-stage renal failure patients are treated with peritoneal dialysis
      (PD). In 2004, there were over 3000 PD patients in Hong Kong. Malnutrition, cardiovascular
      disease and systemic inflammatory state are all common in our clinical practice. They are
      major causes of patient morbidity and mortality. The financial implication is considerable.

      As a readily available anti-cytokine therapy, thalidomide may represent a valuable treatment
      of the MIA syndrome. The proposed study will provide important insight on the clinical
      benefit of thalidomide treatment in malnourished PD patients, which accounts for about
      one-third of our dialysis population.

      Data Analysis

      Statistical analysis will be performed by SPSS for Windows software version 11.5 (SPSS Inc.,
      Chicago, IL). All data will be expressed in mean +/- standard deviation unless otherwise
      specified. Serial changes of nutritional parameters, dialysis adequacy, and inflammatory
      markers will be compared to the baseline values by analysis of variance for multiple measures
      (MANOVA). Serial change in residual GFR is examined by Wilcoxon's rank sum test with
      Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparison because of skewed data. Nutritional status
      and systemic inflammatory markers after one year will be compared between the 2 groups by
      Student's t-test for parametric data. Hospitalization and peritonitis rate between the groups
      are compared by Kruskal-Wallis test because the data will be highly skewed. Actuarial patient
      survival will be compared by logrank test with Kaplan-Meier survival curves and treatment
      group as stratifying variable.

      Simple explanation and rationale:

      Recovery after spine surgery is usually accompanied by severe pain which has traditionally
      been managed with opioids. It is common practice to supplement opioid treatment with
      different classes of analgesics which work through alternative pain pathways and receptors in
      order to achieve an additive or synergistic effect while reducing the amount of opioids
      necessary for pain control.

      Acetaminophen can be a beneficial supplemental analgesic to opioids for postoperative pain
      relief.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized to either the treatment with IV acetaminophen (A), PO
      acetaminophen (B), or hydromorphone control group (C).

      Objective/Purpose:

      Primary objective is to determine the impact of administering a supplemental non-opioid
      analgesic drug such as IV or PO acetaminophen on total opioid dose administered over the
      postoperative period.

      Secondary objectives include investigating the impact of IV/PO acetaminophen on the level of
      postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, and side effects secondary to opioids such as
      nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, respiratory depression, ileus, and urinary retention,
      and PACU (postoperative care unit) discharge time.

      Study population:

      126 patients will be enrolled in the study (42 for group A, 42 for group B, and 42 for
      control group C).

      Follow-up and Endpoints / Outcomes:

      Postoperative assessments will be done at 0, 30, and 60 minutes, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24
      hours after surgery. Patients will be evaluated for pain (using a numeric rating scale),
      total opioid consumption, and for opioid side effects including drowsiness (using the Ramsey
      sedation scale and the Aldrete score at the time of arrival to and discharge from recovery
      room), respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus. Patient satisfaction will also
      be assessed using a numeric rating scale.
    ",The Effectiveness of IV/PO Acetaminophen in the Perioperative Period in Reducing Opiate Use After Lumbar Spine Fusion,"Fusion of Spine, Lumbar Region",,"
      Simple explanation and rationale:

      Recovery after spine surgery, especially spinal fusion surgery, is usually accompanied by
      severe pain which has traditionally been managed with opioids. While opioids have been proven
      effective, they are associated with undesirable side effects including nausea, vomiting,
      pruritus, sedation, respiratory depression, ileus, and urinary retention leading to increased
      time required in recovery and a decrease in patient satisfaction. For this reason, it is
      common practice to supplement opioid treatment with different classes of analgesics which
      work through alternative pain pathways and receptors in order to achieve an additive or
      synergistic effect while reducing the amount of opioids necessary for pain control.

      Acetaminophen is a centrally-acting cyclooxygenase inhibitor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      medication that has minimal, if any, gastrointestinal and platelet-inhibiting side effects,
      and is better tolerated by patients than other cyclooxygenase inhibitors. This medication can
      be a beneficial supplemental analgesic to opioids for postoperative pain relief. Previously
      conducted studies demonstrate a rationale for the use of intravenous/PO acetaminophen in a
      multimodal analgesic regimen to reduce postoperative analgesia.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized to either the treatment with IV acetaminophen (A), PO
      acetaminophen (B), or hydromorphone control group (C). Patients who are randomized to group A
      will receive 1 g of IV acetaminophen during the wound closure and every 4 to 6 hours
      postoperatively for a total of 4 g in 24 hours. Patients who are randomized to group B will
      receive 1 g of PO acetaminophen before surgery and every 4 to 6 hours postoperatively for a
      total of 4 g in 24 hours. Patients who are randomized to control group C will not receive
      acetaminophen. Post-operatively, patients in both groups will also receive IV hydromorphone
      PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) only for 24 hours for pain.

      Objective/Purpose:

      Primary objective is to determine the impact of administering a supplemental non-opioid
      analgesic drug such as IV or PO acetaminophen on total opioid dose administered over the
      postoperative period.

      Secondary objectives include investigating the impact of IV/PO acetaminophen on the level of

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block
      to prevent shoulder tip pain following primary laparoscopic gastric banding, band revision,
      band replacement, primary sleeve gastrectomy or revision of sleeve gastrectomy. Shoulder tip
      pain (STP) is a common problem after laparoscopic surgery, manifesting in the post-anesthesia
      care unit and for days or possibly weeks thereafter (Dixon 2005). Systemic analgesics
      including opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not reliably relieve
      STP. This study is designed to determine if the SPG block, a simple and low-risk procedure,
      effectively treats STP after laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

      The core of the proposal is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study which
      will compare the efficacy of dextran 70 versus human albumin in the treatment of cirrhotic
      patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Because dextran 70, which is FDA
      approved for plasma volume expansion, is significantly less expensive than human albumin,
      this study is designed and powered to determine if dextran 70 is equivalent in clinical
      efficacy when compared to albumin.

      Specific aims for this project are to:

        1. Assess the effect of plasma volume expansion with dextran 70 on disease-specific
           mortality at 30 days in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
           compared to plasma volume expansion with human albumin.

        2. Assess the effect of dextran 70 compared to human albumin on the prevention of renal
           dysfunction within 30-days of diagnosis of SBP, as measured by the calculated creatinine
           clearance, plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone levels, levels of brain natriuretic
           peptide, and further development of the hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhotic patients with
           spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

        3. Compare the survival to liver transplantation, treatment costs, hospitalization costs,
           resource utilization, and quality of life of patients with spontaneous bacterial
           peritonitis treated with dextran 70 and human albumin in the 30 days following
           diagnosis.

        4. Establish a comprehensive tissue bank of blood, ascites, and urine in patients with
           spontaneous bacterial peritonitis for future testing and translational research.

        5. Establish a clinical electronic database with web-based data entry and remote analysis
           capabilities linking tissue bank samples and patient outcomes related to the above
           clinical trials.
    ","Clinical, Inflammatory, and Economic Impact of Dextran 70 in Treating Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis",Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis,Peritonitis,"
      All patients admitted to the University of Virginia Health system who have clinically or
      pathologically defined cirrhosis, laboratory evidence consistent with spontaneous bacterial
      peritonitis and clinically or radiologically accessible ascites will be screened for
      participation in this prospective,randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. All patients
      agreeing to participate will be treated with the standard of care antibiotic and supportive
      therapy and will be randomized to one of two treatment regimens. Treatment arm one will
      consist of human albumin, 1.5 g/kg intravenously administered at the time of enrollment and
      1.0 g/kg administered on day three after enrollment. Treatment arm two will consist of
      dextran 70, 1.0 g/kg intravenously daily for three days. Under separate informed consent from
      the therapeutic portion of the study, all participants will be offered enrollment into the
      tissue repository and prospective outcomes database. Upon consent to enroll in the repository
      and database, serum, ascites, and urine will be collected from participating subjects for
      storage and future evaluation of inflammatory and pathophysiologic factors contributing to
      the morbidity and mortality of SBP and HRS. Prospectively collected clinical and outcomes
      data will be recorded into a perpetual electronic database for future comprehensive outcomes
      and translational studies. Participation in either the tissue repository or perpetual
      clinical database will not be compulsory to enroll in the therapeutic or prophylaxis trials.
      Similarly, subjects can choose not be enrolled in either the database or tissue repository.

      Comprehensive treatment costs incurred in both treatment arms will be collected prospectively
      by study personnel and used to perform a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Micro-costing
      algorithms will be used to derive direct treatment and hospitalization costs for the two
      treatment arms. After data collection is complete, along with the primary statistical
      analysis, a subgroup analysis will be performed to better clarify if benefit from either
      treatment arm is limited to high-risk patients or other specific patient sub-populations. As
      the proposed project is the first prospective, randomized, double-blinded investigation into
      two markedly different therapeutic options for treating SBP, this study will offer the unique
      opportunity to study them in an objective fashion.

      All participants in the study will receive standard of care antibiotic therapy and supportive
      care for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Prior to screening, a paracentesis will have been
      performed and the resulting ascitic fluid sent to the lab for cell count and bacterial
      culture. Ascites culture media will be inoculated at the bedside with at least 10ml of fluid
      per culture container. Once the diagnosis of SBP is established, the patient will receive a
      complete history and physical examination, chest and abdominal radiographs, ultrasound
      examination of the liver including Doppler exam of the hepatic veins, arteries, and portal
      vein to evaluate for thrombosis, peripheral blood laboratory testing including a complete
      blood count with differential, standard serum chemistry and electrolytes including blood urea
      nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, liver panel assay including aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total, direct, and indirect
      bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized
      ratio (INR), plasma renin activity (PRA), serum aldosterone level, and brain natriuretic
      peptide (BNP) level. Peripheral blood cultures will be obtained in standard fashion as per
      institutional protocols with inoculation of blood and body fluid samples directly into
      culture media at the bedside and similarly, central line blood cultures will be obtained if
      applicable. Complete blood cell counts, serum chemistry, and hepatic panels will be repeated
      at least daily for the first three days after diagnosis and at least every other week
      thereafter until 30 days. Levels of PRA, aldosterone, and BNP will be measured at study entry
      and on days two and three in the protocol, and again at day 30. Baseline quality of life will
      be assessed at enrollment and at 30 days. If the subject has consented to tissue banking,
      samples of blood, ascites, and urine will be collected and prepared for storage by study
      personnel. Tissue banking samples will be collected at enrollment, 3 days, and at 30 days
      from each participating subject.

      After initial diagnostic paracentesis performed prior to enrollment, total paracentesis will
      be performed (if not done on the initial paracentesis). Colloid replacement after the initial
      paracentesis will be with the study drug.

      Further therapeutic paracentesis will not be performed until after day three of the study
      protocol. Diuretic therapy will be continued in patients with clinical fluid control problems
      at the discretion of the medical team. However, diuretic use during the first three days of
      the protocol will be closely recorded by study personnel. All subjects will be placed on
      sodium-restricted diet, 2000 mg or less per day. All subjects not allergic to cephalosporins
      will receive intravenous cefotaxime as per a dosing regimen based upon their serum creatinine
      level. Patients with allergies or sensitivities to cephalosporins will receive meropenem as
      per a dosing regimen based upon their serum creatinine level.

      If ascites or blood cultures grow specific bacterial pathogens, antibiotic therapy will be
      tailored to the narrowest spectrum antibiotic necessary for adequate coverage, based on in
      vitro organism susceptibilities. If any ascites is still present, all subjects will have a
      repeat diagnostic paracenteses at 48 hours after diagnosis for repeat of cell counts to
      assess for response to therapy. If ascites and blood cultures are negative, antibiotic
      coverage will be continued for a total of 5 days if clinical and laboratory resolution of the
      infection is verified. If subjects do not respond to initial therapy as measured by ascites
      PMN's not decreasing by 50% after the first 48 hours of treatment, the antibiotic regimen
      will be modified empirically by the primary medical team caring for the patient. Once
      resolution of the infection is established, after 5 days of initial therapy, all patients
      will be placed on ciprofloxacin, 750 mg once weekly for prophylaxis which will be continued
      indefinitely. If the patient is sensitive or allergic to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim /
      sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg once daily for 5 days a week will be used.

      Subjects randomized to treatment with human albumin will receive a total of 1.5 g/kg of
      albumin at the time of enrollment and 1.0 g/kg on day three of the treatment protocol. To
      maintain blinding, the research pharmacy will prepare the 25% albumin solution in order to be
      identical in volume and color to the dextran 70 through the use of a dextrose diluent.
      Because of the different dosing schedules between the two treatment arms in this study,
      equivolume placebo doses of dextrose (5%) will be given on day two when an active treatment
      dose is not scheduled in the albumin arm. Dextrose will be used to avoid the sodium load and
      potential mild plasma volume expansion associated with saline infusion.

      Subjects randomized to treatment with dextran 70 will receive it as a daily intravenous dose
      for the three days of the treatment protocol. A total daily dose of 1.0 g/kg will be
      administered. Because the hemodynamic compromise is often delayed by up to 48 hours after the
      diagnosis of SBP, daily dosing of dextran-70, instead of a single dose regimen, is a better
      pharmacokinetic treatment strategy in addressing the gradually worsening hemodynamic status
      involved with the progression of SBP to HRS. In normal humans, 45-60% of the infused dose of
      dextran-70 is recovered in the urine within 48 hours and the elimination half-life is
      approximately 24 hours. As stated above, in order to preserve blinding, the albumin, placebo,
      and dextran 70 treatment will all be equivolume and visually indistinguishable. An
      intravenous multivitamin additive will be used in the dextran solution in order to assure
      that the 6% dextran and 25% albumin solutions are of the same color. This multivitamin
      diluent has been used successfully for the same purpose in other blinded studies at UVAHS
      with no adverse events or known benefits associated from the multivitamin component.

      We aim to investiagte whether very low dose self management of oral anticoagulation is
      superior to low dose oral anticoagulation in order to prevent bleeding events in patients
      undergoing mechanuical heart valve replacement.
    ",Very Low Dose Oral Anticoagulation and Thromboembolic and Bleeding Complications,Mechanical Heart Valve Recipients,Hemorrhage,"
      In mechanical heart valve recipients, self-management of oral anticoagulation can reduce the
      risk of developing thromboembolic events and improves long-term survival compared with
      international normalized ratio (INR) control by a general practitioner. Low-dose INR
      self-management (INR values of 1.8.-2.8 for aortic valve recipients and 2.5 - 3.5 for mitral
      or double valve recipients) does not increase the risk of thromboembolic events compared to
      conventional dose INR self-management. Even in patients with a low INR target range, however,
      the risk of bleeding events is still higher than the risk of thromboembolism. We therefore
      perform a prospective, randomized trial in 1,800 patients with mechanical heart valve
      replacement. During the first six postoperative months, low dose INR self-management will be
      performed by all patients (INR measurement once a week). Thereafter, 600 patients will
      continue with this treatment regimen, whereas the other 1,200 patients with perform very low
      dose oral anticoagulation. Out of these 1,200 patients, 600 will perform INR measurement once
      a week and 600 patients will perform INR measurement twice a week. Patients are followed up

      Oral corticosteroids are commonly utilized for the management of chronic rhinosinusitis with
      and without nasal polyps (CRSwNP and CRSsNP, respectively). Although strong evidence supports
      the benefit of routine and perioperative oral corticosteroids for CRSwNP, there is limited
      evidence to support their utility for CRSsNP. The investigators intend to perform a
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to investigate the impact of

      Many individuals with Alcohol Dependence do not receive treatment, despite effective
      treatments being available. A significant healthcare challenge is to find ways to bring
      people who have alcohol dependence into treatment programs. Drinking drivers are a group that
      has been shown to have high rates of alcohol dependence. In Ontario, all convicted drinking
      drivers who want to obtain a drivers license must complete Ontario's remedial program for
      convicted drinking drivers called Back on Track (BOT). In this program, those with more
      serious alcohol-related problems are assigned to a group treatment program. While it is
      likely that many of the individual in this group are experiencing alcohol dependence,
      currently there is no formal linkage to any medical services for these problems. In this
      study, the investigators will provide those in the BOT treatment group with information about
      a 24-week study assessing the effectiveness of naltrexone vs. placebo. This study will also
      assess the feasibility and level of interest among this population to obtain treatment for

      BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of several potent antithrombotic agents, the optimal
      antiplatelet regimen in elective patients undergoing complex percutaneous coronary
      interventions is still debated. Aim of the INtegrilin plus STenting to Avoid myocardial
      Necrosis Trial (INSTANT) will be to assess the safety and efficacy of routine usage of the
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide in subjects already treated with aspirin and
      clopidogrel, and undergoing implantation of at least 2 drug-eluting stents in the same
      lesion, thus identifying a clinically stable but anatomically complex patient subset.

      DESIGN: This will be a single-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter randomized trial METHODS:
      Patients with stable coronary artery disease, undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) by means of implantation of >33 mm of DES (eg with two 23-mm DES, or one 32-mm and one
      12-mm DES), will be randomized, after administration of aspirin and clopidogrel (600 mg
      loading dose recommended), to eptifibatide and unfractioned heparin according to the ESPRIT
      protocol vs placebo and unfractioned heparin. Blood draws for CK-MB mass, total CK and
      cardiac troponin levels will be taken at baseline, 6 and 12 hours post-procedurally. Patients
      will be followed for clinical events by direct visit or phone contact up to 6 months. The
      primary end-point of the study will be the rate of abnormal post-PCI CK-MB mass values.
      Secondary end-points will be: the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction
      (MI), urgent target vessel revascularization (TVR), and thrombotic bailout GpIIb/IIIa
      inhibitor therapy within 180 days, and in-hospital, 1-month and 6-month major adverse
      cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal MI, or
      urgent TVR.

      IMPLICATIONS: The INSTANT Study will test for the first time the beneficial impact of routine
      GpIIb/IIIa inhibition on top of double oral antiplatelet treatment in clinically stable yet
      anatomically complex patients undergoing DES-implantation. Results of this single-blind
      randomized trial will provide important insights to improve the management strategy of
      patients and outcomes in the current DES era.

      Multiple monoclonal antibodies (mABs) have been shown to reduce viral burden and improve
      clinical outcomes, have been granted FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in select
      populations, and are routinely used in the UPMC Health System, which has made expanded access
      a priority. However, the comparative effectiveness of these mABS is unknown. The National
      Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has called for expanded access and clinical
      use of mABs, noting it is ""critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as
      predicted"". This pragmatic evaluation will determine the relative effects of the EUA-governed
      mABs versus each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes
      EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mABs will accordingly change.

      While COVID-19 vaccination will reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, the learned
      immune response may vary between individuals. This means interventions such as monoclonal
      antibodies (mAB) will still be needed to prevent progression of COVID-19 illness. Monoclonal
      antibodies seek to mimic or enhance the natural immune system response against a pathogen and
      are often used in the care of patients with cancer or infection.

      For viral infections, mABs are created by exposing a white blood cell to a particular viral
      protein, which is then cloned to mass produce antibodies to target that virus. For
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, IgG1 mABs target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
      and block viral attachment and entry into cells.

      The SARS-CoV-2 mABs bamlanivimab and etesevimab, and the REGN-COV2 combination (casirivimab +
      imdevimab) reduce nasopharyngeal viral burden plus clinical outcomes including future
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Each received FDA Emergency Use
      Authorization (EUA) for use in selected populations.

      As of February 2021, there are over 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed daily in the US,
      with over 7000 daily COVID-19 related hospital admissions. Although case volumes are
      currently declining, COVID-19 remains a significant public health threat.

      Despite the EUAs, the clinical use of mABs is low due in part to lack of patient access,
      complexities in drug allocation, and lack of knowledge among providers are contributing
      factors. Further, the comparative effectiveness of different mABs is unknown and not yet
      directly studied. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently
      called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs, noting it is ""critical to collect data
      and evaluate whether they are working as predicted"". This evaluation seeks to determine their
      relative effects versus each other, starting with those governed by EUAs.

      OPTIMISE-C19 is a quality improvement (QI) study, governed by approvals from both the UPMC QI
      committee and the University of Pittsburgh IRB. Currently, mAB therapy is approved for use
      under EUA issued by the FDA. There are no data on the relative benefits of one mAB versus any
      other. mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order and the order is
      filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. The selection of mABs available within
      pharmacy is overseen by the UPMC pharmacy and therapeutics committee. OPTIMISE-C19 provides
      the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. The UPMC Quality Improvement Committee
      approved the OPTIMISE-C19 study, including the random therapeutic interchange. The University
      of Pittsburgh IRB considered the randomized therapeutic interchange to be quality improvement
      and approved the additional data collection and analyses.

      Patients provide verbal consent to receive mAB therapy. UPMC requires physicians to provide
      and review with patients the EUA Fact Sheet for each mAB, and explain that the patient could
      receive any of the EUA-governed mABs. As per EUA requirements, physicians discuss the risks
      and benefits of mABs with patients, and patients consent to receive a mAB as part of routine
      care, should they desire mAB treatment. Patients are told which mAB they are receiving, and
      physicians and patients can agree to the assigned mAB or request a specific mAB. It is the
      treating physicians' and patients' choice to accept the assigned mAB or not. The QI committee
      considered these steps to represent adequate consent to participate. The IRB considered that
      the provision of mAB therapy therefore fell under quality improvement and only the additional
      data collection and analyses represented research. The IRB waived any additional consent
      requirements.

      This study aims to analyse the effect of two total parenteral nutrition diets with lipid
      emulsions of different compositions on the incidence of nosocomial infection in critical
      patients. One diet will contain an MCT/LCT emulsion concentrated to 20% (50:50 ratio) and the
      other will comprise an MCT/LCT/fish oil emulsion (50:40:10 ratio). The secondary objective of
      this study is to analyse mortality in hospital and up to 6 months of discharge.
    ","ICULIP, Influence of Two Lipid Emulsions in the Nosocomial Infection in Critical Patients",Critical Illness,"['Cross Infection', 'Critical Illness']","
      During the last years the most widely used lipid emulsion for parenteral nutrition has been
      based on soybean oil. This first generation of lipid emulsions used in TPN contained w-6
      series polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids (LCT) from soy, maize, sunflower and safflower
      oil. LCT contain an excess of linoleic acid which, when metabolised, produce large quantities
      of arachidonic acid and its metabolites. Although the generally used doses seem safe (1-2
      g/kg/day by continuous perfusion), alterations in pulmonary function in patients with acute
      adult respiratory distress syndrome have been described, as have alterations in platelet
      function, hepatic function and haemodynamics, which are attributed to the excess of said
      metabolites. However, the most important side effect of the LCT lipid infusions is its
      influence on the immune response. Experimental and clinical studies show that LCT can
      interfere with various stages of the immune response such as the production of antibodies,
      complement synthesis, granulocytic and lymphocytic activity and the reticuloendothelial
      system. Various hypotheses have been formulated to explain the modulator effect of the
      polyunsaturated fatty acids on immune function: changes in the permeability of the cellular
      membrane, modifications in the synthesis of eicosanoids and the presence of peroxides derived
      from the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

      In summary, although linoleic acid as a dietary essential fatty acid is important, its
      excessive intake is associated with undesirable immunological and inflammatory events. Thus
      it is recommended that soybean oil should be partly replaced by other lipids.

      To avoid these side effects the second generation lipid emulsions were developed. These
      contain a combination of medium- and long-chain fatty acids (MCT/LCT) with lower w-6 fatty
      acid content. MCT/LCT lipid emulsions are safe and do not produce biochemical or metabolic
      alterations or gaseous exchange in patients with ARDS. MCT/LCT combinations seem to reduce
      the generation of eicosanoids and do not alter the immune response in in-vitro and
      experimental studies. The impact of these differences on the nosocomial infection and the
      clinical prognosis of the patients has not been studied sufficiently despite the fact that
      some studies show reduced mortality and morbidity using MCT/LCT emulsions when compared with
      the use of pure LCT emulsions. MCT/LCT emulsions are normally used in clinical practice on
      patients that have required parenteral nutrition for 20 years.

      Recently, the clinical use in artificial nutrition of omega-3 series polyunsaturated fatty
      acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) present in many fish oils
      has been significant. EPA is a precursor to certain eicosanoid series that compensate the
      proinflammatory effects of the eicosanoids in arachidonic acid (omega-6 series). The
      objective is immunomodulation to attenuate the inflammatory response of patients without
      negatively impacting on the immune function. The use of enteral diets enriched with omega-3
      series fatty acids (fish oil) in post-operation cancer patients showed a reduction in the
      number of days in hospital and infectious complications.

      The use of fish oil or fat emulsions enriched with fish oil (omega-3) in parenteral nutrition
      has already been the subject of various studies: where modulation of the inflammatory
      response markers has been shown, reduces the stay in hospital and the need for mechanical
      ventilation in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, reduces the stay in hospital in
      patients undergoing digestive surgery… So, w-3 lipids exhibit strong immunologic properties.
      They offer the possibility to counterbalance the negative effects of conventional w-6 fatty
      acids. Recent studies exhibit positive effects of intravenous use of fish oil on immunologic
      functions and clinical parameters in surgical and septic patients

      The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of two total parenteral nutrition diets
      with lipid emulsions of different compositions on the incidence of nosocomial infection in
      critical patients. One diet will contain an MCT/LCT emulsion concentrated to 20% (50:50

      Section 3 Study Design and Methods:

      Our proposal is to perform a randomized double-blind, three-arm, three-way cross-over study
      in which subjects with HAE would be placed into one of three different treatment groups based
      on computer randomization. Subjects will be randomized to receive placebo, 1000 units, or
      1500 units of C1-INH at the onset of prodromal symptoms although they would be blinded to
      which one they were receiving. Randomization will be to one of the two doses or placebo and
      the sequence of further treatments will be determined randomly in a double-blinded fashion by
      a person who is not involved in the study. The randomized drug will be available 24 hours and
      7 days a week. They would have to come to the study office to receive the blinded drug, and
      would need to seek treatment within 6 hours of the onset of the prodrome. Following the
      blinded treatment, the subject would need to be observed for at least 30 minutes. If a
      subject develops an acute HAE exacerbation in any of the three treatment periods, they would
      have access to 20 units/kg of open label C1-INH for acute treatment also received at the
      study office, and the time from onset of symptoms of an acute attack until the time the
      subject sought open-label treatment could not exceed 12 hours. Following open label rescue,
      the subject would need to be observed for at least 1 hour or until symptoms started to
      improve. The subject would also be expected to complete a symptom diary card over the next 24
      hours after receiving open-label C1-INH to monitor severity and duration of symptoms (24 Hour
      Prodrome/Open-Label Diary Appendix IV) associated with the acute attack. The number,
      duration, and severity of acute HAE attacks would be compared for each treatment period. Each
      treatment period would last 16 weeks so each subject would be studied for a total of 48
      weeks. Because safety has been established when C1-INH is used every third day with
      prophylaxis therapy, and patients may receive C1-INH for an attack without limits on the
      closeness of the attacks, our patients in this study may be retreated for prodromal symptoms
      as they require it, but not more than every other day since prodromes may precede the
      swelling and abdominal pain by up to 2 days.

      Thrombosis has been identified with C1-INH, but only in neonates who were premature and at
      much higher doses than 1500 units every third day. Cinryze, also a C1-INH, is FDA approved
      for 1000 units every third day for prophylaxis. The dosing used in our study reflects the FDA
      approval dosing for Berinert, which is 20 units per kg for acute therapy, so that most
      patients will receive 1000 to 2500 units of C1-inh whenever they have an attack without day
      restrictions between dosing. The dosage approved by the FDA is 20 units per kg for Berinert
      and 1000 units total dose for Cinryze. The dose used in our study approximates these doses,
      but is not an FDA approved dose. There are no limits on how often Berinert can be dosed for
      acute attacks.

      This research is being done to determine whether the success rate of in vitro fertilization

      Specific Aim:

        1. To determine whether addition of letrozole to gonadotropins would reduce the amount of
           gonadotropins used in an IVF-ET cycle, thereby reducing the cost.

        2. To determine whether letrozole improves IVF-ET success compared to standard ovarian
           stimulation protocols.

      Null Hypothesis: Use of Letrozole for ovulation induction in IVF is not less expensive than
      the standard therapy by a clinically relevant amount.

      Alternative Hypothesis: Use of Letrozole for ovulation induction in IVF is better than the
      standard therapy by a clinically relevant amount.

      Protocol:

      Infertile women <40 years of age with age-appropriate ovarian reserve (as determined by
      day2/3 E2, FSH, and AMH) will be randomized between two protocols: one with letrozole and one
      with standard ovulation induction.

      In both groups, serum FSH will be measured each time a sample is obtained for estradiol. Sera
      will be frozen for further batch assay.

      Number of embryos to be transferred will be decided following the ASRM guidelines. The day of
      embryo transfer (D-3 vs D-5) will be based on the number and quality of embryos as per
      established clinical criteria.

      Power Considerations

      A review of 1473 cycles of patients less than 40 years old over the last 6 years (2002 -
      2008) revealed average cost per cycle to be $3,152 +/- 1685(SD).

      For the purpose of this power analysis we consider a 20% decrease in medication cost to be
      clinically significant. Thus a decrease from $ 3152.83 to $ 2522.26 will be considered
      clinically significant (20% decrease). For an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% for a two
      tailed test 113 patients will need to complete each arm.

      Allowing for 10% drop-out we will attempt to randomize 125 patients to each arm of the study.

      Pain following surgery continues to be an important adverse outcome that may impact
      postoperative recovery. Opioids like fentanyl and hydromorphone are the primary medications
      used to provide analgesia, but paradoxically, may actually worsen pain when administered in
      the operating room. Methadone is a unique opioid which has N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor blocking properties, which may prevent the development of opioid-induced tolerance
      and hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain induced by a drug). Studies have demonstrated
      that methadone reduces the need for analgesic medications and decreases pain after surgery.
      Furthermore, the addition of methadone to a standard anesthetic has been demonstrated to
      increase patient satisfaction with pain management and reduce the need for opioid analgesic
      medications during the first month after surgery. Some investigators have described methadone
      as a ""opioid-sparing opioid"" and recommended its use as part of a multimodal pain management
      strategy.

      There is a growing interest in reducing the use of traditional opioids in the operating room.
      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare pain scores and analgesic requirements in two
      groups of patients; one group will be randomized to receive a small dose of methadone at the
      start of surgery. The other group will be randomized to receive an equal volume of saline
      (salt water-control group) at the start of surgery. We hypothesize that patients randomized
      to be administered methadone at the start of surgery will have less postoperative pain and
      may require lower doses of pain medications than those given saline-control..
    ",Intraoperative Methadone for Postoperative Pain Control After Thoracic Surgery,Postoperative Pain,"Pain, Postoperative","
      Despite the development of a number of treatment strategies for pain after surgery, many
      patients continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain in the early postoperative period.
      Traditionally, opioids are the primary method of providing analgesia in the operating room,
      postanesthesia care unit (PACU), intensive care unit, and surgical wards. However, a number
      of potentially life-threatening complications can develop following opioid administration
      including severe respiratory depression. In addition, studies have demonstrated an
      association between the dose of opioid used in the operating room and the intensity of pain
      after following surgery; paradoxically, the greater the dose of opioid administered, the
      higher the reported pain scores are in the early recovery period. This is likely secondary to
      two interrelated phenomena: tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Tolerance, a
      pharmacologic concept, can develop acutely after a single dose of opioid in the operating
      room. This can result in increased requirements for postoperative pain medications.
      Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), a clinical concept, involves enhancement of existent pain
      stimuli (normally minimally painful incisions may feel much worse) and facilitation of
      chronic pain development. Therefore, it may be beneficial to use lower doses of
      intraoperative opioids on all surgical patients.

      Using a multimodal approach to pain management has been demonstrated to reduce the
      requirements for postoperative analgesic agents and improve pain scores. A number of
      different agents have been investigated including gabapentinoids, lidocaine, steroids, and
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although it is an opioid, another medication that may
      be considered as part of a multimodal treatment of pain is methadone. Methadone has several
      unique properties that may beneficially impact the recovery of the surgical patient. It has
      been extensively studied as an agent to provide prolonged postoperative analgesia. When
      larger doses of methadone have been administered intravenously at induction of anesthesia, a
      median duration of analgesia lasting more than 25 hours has been reported. In patients
      undergoing abdominal, orthopedic, or gynecologic surgery, the use of a single dose of
      methadone (20 mg or 0.2-0.3 mg/kg) before surgical incision resulted in improved analgesia
      for the first 24-48 hours after surgery, when compared to other intraoperative opioids. In
      these investigations, patients in the methadone groups required significantly less
      postoperative pain medication and reported lower pain scores during the first or second
      postoperative days. However, other investigations have demonstrated significant analgesic
      effects of smaller doses of methadone (0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg). Furthermore, reductions in pain
      scores and need for oral opioid medications for the first 30 postoperative days have been
      observed in surgical patients administered 0.15 mg/kg of methadone. In addition to a long
      plasma half-life, methadone has other properties which may be advantageous in surgical
      patients. Recent evidence has demonstrated that methadone has the ability to block
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA receptors have been implicated in the development
      of postoperative hyperalgesia (amplification of pain stimuli), and techniques which block
      NMBA receptors reduce pain. Therefore, methadone may attenuate postoperative pain via this
      additional mechanism. NMDA receptor stimulation is also thought to play an important role in
      the development of chronic pain. Although unproven, it has been hypothesized that methadone
      may reduce the risk of development of chronic postsurgical pain via inhibition of NMDA
      receptors. No adverse events directly attributable to methadone have been reported in any of
      the published clinical trials.

      The aim of this randomized clinical investigation is to assess two cohorts of patients; one
      group will receive a dose of methadone at induction of anesthesia (0.15 mg/kg ideal body
      weight (IBW)-methadone group)). The other group will be randomized to be administered an
      equal volume of saline in an identical appearing syringe (control group).. The primary
      endpoint will be pain scores 24 hours after surgery. Secondary endpoints will include pain
      scores on arrival and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and at 2, 6, 24,
      48, and 72 hours (if the patient remains in the hospital) after surgery. Analgesic
      requirements in the PACU and surgical wards will be assessed. In addition, the incidence of
      potential methadone-related side effects will be measured (delayed emergence, nausea and
      vomiting, respiratory depression)). Furthermore, methadone has been documented to potentially
      reduce the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain. A survey with a self-addressed stamped
      envelope will be provided to patients at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery to complete to
      assess the effect of methadone on this important outcome variable.

      Chronic glomerular diseases are one of the main causes leading to end stage renal disease
      (ESRD). Hypertension and proteinuria are two modifiable factors promoting the progression of
      ESRD. Podocyte are terminally differentiated epithelial cells and play a central role in the
      progression of chronic kidney disease and in the development of glomerulosclerosis. The
      presence of podocyte in urines (podocyturia) has been documented by several teams with
      continuous and regular podocyturia during glomerular disease. This facts suggests that
      podocyturia could become a marker of podocyte loss and glomerular damage. In our university
      hospital, we developed a technique to evaluate the number of microparticles (cellular
      fragments) in different biologic samples. The podocytary origin of microparticles will be

      Background: Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been
      shown to reduce breakthrough narcotic consumption following orthopaedic, neurosurgical, and
      obstetrical procedures. The morphine-sparing effect of ketorolac may reduce respiratory and
      central nervous system depression post operatively, while still providing adequate pain
      control for patients. Patients undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast
      reconstruction may particularly benefit from ketorolac postoperatively, and ultimately be
      safely discharged from hospital sooner than their counterparts receiving standard of care.

      Research Question: In adult women post-mastectomy, undergoing abdominally based microsurgical
      breast reconstruction, does a postoperative regimen of intravenous ketorolac tromethamine, in
      addition to standard of care, reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay compared with
      an intravenous sham saline regimen?

      Study Design: A single center, explanatory, placebo-controlled, 1:1 allocation, 2-arm,
      parallel group, superiority, randomized, and double blinded, controlled trial.

      Population: The study population includes all females >18 years old post mastectomy
      consenting to abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction.

      Intervention and Comparator: The intervention will be ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hours
      postoperatively for 72 hours. The comparator will be a sham intravenous administration of
      normal saline.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome is hospital length of stay postoperatively. Secondary outcomes
      include visual analog scale for pain, breakthrough narcotic consumption, surgical drain
      outputs, hematoma, and other complications.

      Sample Size: Available data provided estimates for average length of hospital stay and
      standard deviation. A minimally clinically significant difference of 1 day was decided on due
      to expert opinion. Based on a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05, and inflated to account for
      attrition and efficiency losses, a total of 50 patients (25 per group) will be required for
      this study.
    ",Ketorolac for Analgesia followiNG Autologous Breast RecOnstructiOn,Breast Cancer Female,,"
      Breast reconstruction (BR) is commonly requested following mastectomy, and recent measures
      have been taken to ensure patient access is universal. Transferring autologous tissue from
      the abdomen using microvascular surgical techniques provides a reliable reconstruction method
      with high levels of patient satisfaction, and is routinely performed. However, the surgery is
      relatively complex and lengthy; operative times can exceed six hours and hospital stay ranges
      from 5-9 days. During each patient's postoperative course she must meet certain milestones
      before discharge. It has been shown that beyond the necessary monitoring of the viability of
      the free flap, pain and a patient's ability to mobilize are important modifiable barriers to
      discharge.

      Pain control following autologous BR is multimodal, but predominantly relies on opioids.
      Narcotics provide effective analgesia, but have a well-known side effect profile that
      includes drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, sedation, central nervous system and respiratory
      depression. Each of these potential adverse effects limits patients' mobility after surgery.
      Respiratory depression is particularly disadvantageous, as these patients have undergone
      major abdominal musculature dissection that also disrupts their mechanics of breathing 10 .
      This may have the counterproductive effect of limiting patient mobilization, and ultimately
      delay discharge. In a health care system where resources are at a premium and costs are
      climbing, any inexpensive intervention that allows for an earlier and safe discharge is
      worthy of consideration.

      No standard approach to postoperative pain control in free flap BR exists. Most protocols are
      institution dependent, and variably incorporate narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen and other agents. In addition, these medications are given via
      oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. Recent studies have investigated the use of
      transversus abdominis plane blocks as an analgesic adjunct, and patients are often provided
      with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps in the early postoperative period.

      Ketorolac tromethamine is an NSAID, which is approved by Health Canada for short-term pain
      control (Toradol, Hoffmann-La Roche Limited, 7070 Mississauga Road Mississauga, Ontario).
      Ketorolac provides better pain control than the most commonly used NSAIDs, and its potency is
      comparable to that of morphine. However, it does not have the same listed side effects of
      drowsiness and respiratory depression as do narcotics. Surgeons often cite concern regarding
      postoperative bleeding when using NSAIDs, however recent reviews have convincingly
      demonstrated the safety for use of NSAIDs in plastic surgery. A previous observational study
      has also shown the safety of ketorolac specifically following autologous BR. The routine
      addition of ketorolac following surgery has been shown to reduce patients' narcotic
      requirements in other fields of surgery, such as orthopaedics and gynaecology.

      Given the abovementioned advantages of ketorolac, and the particular propensity for
      abdominally based free flap BR patients to be negatively affected by narcotic side effects,
      we hypothesize that the addition of ketorolac to a routine multimodal postoperative analgesia
      regimen will reduce hospital stay by a day or more.

      The comparator for this study will be a placebo. Patients randomized both to the control
      group and those randomized to the intervention group will receive standard of care
      postoperatively, which will include pain control with scheduled acetaminophen and pro re nata
      oral and subcutaneous hydromorphone. In addition, control patients will receive a placebo
      with the same scheduling as the study drug, ketorolac. The rationale for this choice is to
      limit potential sources of bias, such as the patient and her care team, and maximize the
      accuracy of the primary outcome and patient-completed questionnaires that will serve as a
      secondary outcome. Other authors have previously successfully used placebos for ketorolac in
      their study design.

      The majority of surgeons at our institution currently do not employ ketorolac in their
      postoperative pain control regimen. Thus, there exists clinical equipoise for patients
      considering participating and potentially being randomized into the control group, when
      compared with declining participation and receiving usual care.

      This study will be single-centered and conducted in Nova Scotia, Canada. The Halifax
      Infirmary is a level III trauma center with multiple board certified Plastic surgeons who
      have undertaken extra training in microsurgery.

      Participants will be removed from the study upon request. Her data up until that point will
      be used for statistical analysis, however she would no longer receive the intervention.
      Modifications to intervention dosing would occur if a participant develops any drug
      hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally any major harm attributed to ketorolac will prompt a
      termination of the intervention.

      Each patient will undergo uni- or bilateral abdominally based free flap harvest,
      microsurgical anastomoses, and flap inset. Following randomization, the study drug will be
      sent to the main operating theatre, and attached to the patient's medical chart. At the
      conclusion of surgery, each patient will be administered their first dose of the study drug.
      Its content will depend on the patient's randomized group. If randomized to the ketorolac
      intervention group, the IV minibag will contain 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine, or if in the
      control group it will be a sham normal saline IV minibag. They then will continue to receive
      their assigned drug every 6 hours for 72 hours. Patients all receive 1:1 care from nursing
      staff in the early postoperative period, and their nurse will administer all drugs given on
      the surgical ward.

      All patients who have enrolled will receive the usual care for the postoperative period. The
      study drug will be in addition to usual flap monitoring, patient vital sign monitoring,
      progression of mobilization, drain management, along with the other care provided for these
      patients. Patients also will have the same background analgesic and anti-emetics medications
      ordered postoperatively, which is included on a standardized pre-printed order form at the
      Halifax Infirmary for this particular surgery.

      Potential participants will first be introduced to the study following their initial
      consultation for BR. If the patient consents for abdominally based microsurgical BR, then the
      study will be reviewed, allowing time for any questions to be asked, and the risks and
      benefits to be discussed. The patient will be sent home with a study package that includes a
      copy of the study consent form and protocol. The study will be reviewed again at a
      preoperative appointment, allowing time for any follow up questions to be asked. This is a
      routine appointment intended for markings and patient questions regarding surgery, and the
      patient will officially be enrolled in the study if she wishes to participate at either
      time-point - the initial consultation or the preoperative appointment. Following the surgery,
      each patient will remain active in the study until her discharge from hospital. No follow up
      appointments or data will be scheduled or recorded for the purposes of the study (although
      follow up will occur as per usual with these patients and their respective surgeon).
      Therefore total enrolment time for each patient will be from the appointment immediately
      before surgery to her discharge from hospital.

      A computer-generated algorithm will be used to randomize patients in a 1:1 allocation into
      the intervention or control group during surgery. Randomization will be stratified by
      laterality of the reconstruction (i.e. bi- or unilateral) because this could affect
      participant pain levels. Randomization will be managed and maintained by a third party
      service, not otherwise involved in the study, in the hospital pharmacy department. Allocation
      methods will not be disclosed to study investigators. Following randomization, the study drug
      will be sent to the main operating theatre, and given at the conclusion of the surgery. Both
      the intervention and control drug will be of the same storage and opacity to prevent
      identification by the patient or care providers. From there, the patient will then be
      administered the same drug according to the randomization result, based on delivery by the
      third party pharmacy service.

      Randomization will be carried out within the pharmacy department placing patients into either
      the intervention or control group. The intervention and control intravenous drugs will be
      prepared in the same style IV minibag with the same volume and opacity of fluid. The fluids
      will be of similar viscosity. Once similar appearances and features are confirmed the
      prepared drug will be sent to the operating theatre or the ward as required depending on the
      time point.

      During the conduction of this study all involved trial participants, clinicians, data
      collectors, event adjudicators, and data analysts will be blinded to the grouping of
      patients. All study medications will be stored in the hospital pharmacy department by a third
      party. Following randomization, treatment drugs will be dispensed by the pharmacy and then
      administered by nursing staff. The third party service will maintain records linking a
      patient unique identifier to her study group. Post hoc analysis to assess whether staff could
      identify between the intervention and placebo will be conducted.

      Harms will be classified as either minor or major. Minor harms will include surgical site
      infection and those listed from prior clinical trials on the drug monograph, namely:

      Over 40 million Americans take statins to reduce their risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease (ASCVD). Unfortunately, 10 to 20% stop taking them due to statin-associated muscle
      symptoms (e.g. pain, aches, weakness, cramps, or stiffness) (1, 2). The pathophysiology of
      these statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) has remained elusive. Consequently, no
      objective diagnostic method exists, causing confusion for patient and providers since muscle
      symptoms can often be multifactorial.
    ",7T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Skeletal Muscle Biopsy Findings in Statin Associated Adverse Muscle Events,"['Muscle Cramp', 'Ache', 'Weakness, Muscle', 'Statin Adverse Reaction']","['Muscle Cramp', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Spasm']","
      The overall objectives of this project are to identify the underlying cause of SAMS and
      establish an in-vivo imaging technique to detect SAMS. The central hypothesis of this
      pro-posal is that statins directly inhibit mitochondrial function in SAMS patients. Our
      rationale is based on our own preliminary data indicating that simvastatin - the most common
      statin to cause SAMS - can directly inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mice. Since
      such changes can be detected in vivo in humans utilizing 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS) techniques, the investigators will use a state-of-the art 7 Tesla (7T) MRS instrument
      to study the so-leus muscles of SAMS patients. Additionally, the investigators will validate
      the MRS findings by doing func-tional studies in muscle biopsy specimens.

      The investigators propose double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 15 SAMS
      pa-tients and 15 controls. Study participants will be treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily or
      place-bo for 10 weeks. The investigators will perform 7T MRS of soleus muscles at
      randomization and either at first complaint of muscle symptoms or at the end of 10 weeks if
      no muscle symptoms occur, whichever occurs first. Quadriceps muscle biopsies will also be
      done immediately following the second MRS scan.

      Patiromer add-on to a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) in patients with Type 2
      diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) will reduce blood pressure and left
      ventricular (LV) mass to a greater extent compared to patients with MRA alone and favorably
      affect key secondary hemodynamic and inflammatory variables including atherosclerosis
      progression.

      Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Type II diabetes. A cell
      type called the monocyte/macrophage is critical to development and complications of
      atherosclerosis.

      This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a medication called Spironolactone in
      addition to Patiromer in preventing atherosclerosis in Type II diabetes through its effects
      on cells such as the monocyte. Spironolactone has been demonstrated to be effective for the
      treatment of patients after a heart attack and stroke. The investigators will evaluate the
      impact of Spironolactone in combination with Patiromer in reducing atherosclerosis plaque and
      additionally evaluate its potential in changing inflammation.

      The investigators envision that a strategy of simultaneously probing effect of a drug
      combined with analysis of mechanisms of action and predictive response will likely provide
      key information with which to design hard event (heart attack, stroke etc.) based trials.
    ",Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism Clinical Evaluation in Atherosclerosis Add-On,"['Type2 Diabetes', 'Hyperkalemia']","['Atherosclerosis', 'Hyperkalemia']","
      There is substantial interest in preventing cardiovascular (CV) and renal disease progression
      in the Type 2 diabetic. Activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis (RAS) and the
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) results in pro-inflammatory effects. Further the phenomenon
      of aldosterone escape provides a rationale for MR antagonism in addition to an ACEI/ARB
      agent. Agents that target the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) cascade have shown
      benefit in Type 2 Diabetics although combined RAS blockade such as using ACEI+ARB or
      ACEI/ARB+Renin inhibition have met with failure primarily owing to adverse effects such as
      hypotension and renal failure/hyperkalemia requiring dialysis. It has been speculated that
      dual RAS blockade or use of ACEI/ARB in conjunction with MRA may potentially be beneficial if
      one controls hyperkalemia and/or avoid excess hypotension. As a foundation for this current
      proposal, the investigators have demonstrated an important role for RAAS and MR antagonism in
      reducing atherosclerosis and inflammation in experimental animal models and limited studies
      in humans. The investigators are currently testing the efficacy of Spironolactone in reducing
      atherosclerosis on top of ACEI/ARB in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with
      concomitant CKD as part of a Randomized Double-blind controlled clinical trial. Given the
      fact that as much as 20-40% of a diabetic patient population with CKD may have problems of
      hyperkalemia on spironolactone, particularly those already on angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor (ACEI)/ARB therapy, that would preclude their participation in this trial, the
      investigators would like to propose an open label supplemental arm to where patients who are
      ineligible for participation owing to baseline hyperkalemia or hyperkalemia on the dose
      escalation phase will be eligible to participate in the PRIMARY-Add on trial. The addition of
      Patiromer will enable introduction of MRA therapy at therapeutic doses and avoidance of
      hyperkalemia. The investigators thus propose a prospective open label trial with blinded
      assessment of end-points (PROBE) study which test the relative safety and efficacy of
      Patiromer on top of Spironolactone in T2DM on LV mass regression and occurrence of
      hypokalemia (Co-Primary End-points) as well as its effect on 24-hour ambulatory blood
      pressure (ABP) at 6 weeks, central aortic blood pressure at 6 weeks, atherosclerosis
      progression at 12 months and measures of monocyte inflammatory potential. If successful, the
      studies outlined in this proposal will extend the utility of Patiromer in high-risk diabetics
      at risk for future CV events and provide new information.

      Background : Headaches are a common presentation for children consulting to the Emergency
      Department (ED). However, only few studies have evaluated the rapid pain improvement provided
      by medications in the acute management of headaches in the pediatric population.

      Objective : To evaluate pain reduction provided by intranasal fentanyl (INF) compared to
      placebo in addition to ibuprofen for children presenting to a pediatric ED with moderate to
      severe headaches.

      Methods : A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial will
      be conducted in an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care pediatric hospital ED. All
      children eight to 18 years old who will present to the ED with headaches as a main chief
      complaint and with pain of ≥ 36 mm out of 100 on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be recruited.
      Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive INF 1.5 mcg/kg (maximum dose of 100
      mcg) or similar volume of a placebo solution via an atomizer. Co-administration of oral
      ibuprofen 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 600 mg) will also be provided to the two groups if not
      received in the previous 4 hours. The primary outcome will be the mean pain rating reduction
      at 15 minutes. The secondary outcomes will be mean pain reduction at 30 and 60 minutes,
      patient's and parental satisfaction levels, percent of being pain free, sedation score,
      immediate and within 72 hours adverse events, additional ED analgesics and other medications,
      length of ED stay, disposition outcomes, hospital admission rate and ED revisit rate within
      72 hours. The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach to compare mean pain
      score reduction between the two groups using a Student's T-test. The sample size of 60
      participants per arm was calculated to have a power of 80% to identify a difference of 10 mm
      in the VAS.

      Expected results : Our study might demonstrate that INF provides additional pain relief for
      children presenting to an ED with headaches. Providing INF could relieve their symptoms more
      quickly, potentially improve patient's and family's satisfaction, possibly reduce the length
      of their ED stay and consequently, have a significant impact on patient quality of care and
      cost-effectiveness.
    ",RCT Evaluating Intranasal Fentanyl in the Pain Management of Children With Headaches,Headaches,Headache,"
      The primary objective of the present study would be to determine the additive value on
      analgesic effectiveness of INF in children aged eight to 18 years with acute moderate to
      severe headaches. We would also aim to gather information on the safety and acceptability of
      INF for headaches. We believe that providing INF for moderate to severe headaches will
      decrease pain levels in children aged 8 to 18 years old.

      We will perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      The study setting will be a single center, urban, university-based, tertiary care pediatric
      university-affiliated hospital ED with an annual census of 75,000 patient visits. The study
      should be conducted between 2015-2018.

      Study population : Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who
      present to the pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches, regardless of the type, with
      a moderate or severe pain score. Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal
      to 36 mm on the VAS as demonstrated by Hirschfeld et. Al. This level have been chosen because
      it has been recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only
      be obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any
      treatment.

      Intervention: All patients will receive a 1.5 mcg⁄kg dose of fentanyl or an equivalent volume
      of similar looking placebo. This will be administered intranasally via a mucosal atomiser
      device (MAD) using 50 mcg/mL solution with a 2 mL syringe. Prior studies have shown that this
      dose is as effective as IV or IM morphine and provides a bioavailability which is 71% of the
      IV dose. The minimum dose prescribed will be 20 mcg, to ensure delivery of 15 mcg of fentanyl
      to a 10 kg child, allowing for the MAD dead space of 0.1 mL (5 mcg of fentanyl). For
      analgesic dose-volumes equal to and less than 0.5 mL, the entire dose will be administered in
      one nostril; doses above 0.5 mL will be divided equally and administered to both nostrils.
      Concentrated medications in a small volume (0.2-0.3 mL per nostril) are ideal, whereas
      volumes in excess of 1 mL per nostril are not reliably absorbed as a result of mucosal
      surface saturation and runoff from the nasal cavity. The maximum dose administered will be
      100 mcg due to volume constraints. The placebo solution will consist of normal saline that
      would be delivered via the proposed atomiser. The value administered will be adjusted to the
      patients weight as for the active study medication. No additional dose of either study
      medication would be provided. A MAD have been chosen because it is suggested to increase the
      mucosal coverage and absorption of the medication by atomizing particles and decreasing the
      amount of medication lost due to swallowing.

      Oral ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) (maximum dose of 600 mg) will also be administered within the first
      15 minutes of intranasal administration of the study medication unless it had been given in
      the previous 4 hours. It has been chosen over acetaminophen because a direct comparison has
      shown that complete pain relief after two hours is achieved twice as frequently with
      ibuprofen.

      The randomization process will occur at the local pharmacy and randomization allotment will
      be known only by a pharmacist who is not involved in the study. Therefore, all providers
      involved in the patient's care and patients will be blinded to group assignment until data
      analysis completion. The participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups as
      follows : 1) INF 1.5 mcg/kg and 2) placebo solution, given via an atomizer (MAD device: MAD
      Nasal, U.S. Patent #6,112,743, Wolfe-Tory Medical, Inc., 79 West 4500 South, Salt Lake City,
      Utah 84107).

      The study medications will be provided to the ED by the local pharmacy. For each randomized
      patient, a consecutive study medication package will be opened in the ED. Each study package
      will contain a study medication (either generic fentanyl bottle or saline bottle), a syringe
      and an atomizer for delivery. An on-site nurse will withdraw the study medication from the
      specific bottle provided in the package and will deliver the study medication to the patient.
      The study research assistant will remain blinded. At the pharmacy, the patient's
      identification will be coded so that only a user having the access code will be able to
      identify participants.

      Procedure : Every patient will be weighed in triage. Enrollment will be limited to times when
      a research assistant is available. A research assistant will recruit the patients after a
      pediatric ED physician has assessed them and once the symptoms of headaches are clearly
      established. The pain associated with headaches will be assessed by using the VAS, which has
      been validated for the use in children aged eight years and older across a variety of
      clinical settings and has an excellent interrater-reliability and validity in analgesia
      research.

      Once eligibility and exclusion criteria will be confirmed, caregivers will be given written
      and verbal study information. Written consent for enrolment will be gained from both the
      accompanying parent and the child, when appropriate. The research assistant will use timers
      to coordinate all the events. At baseline, before any intervention, the VAS score, baseline
      vital signs and sedation score (UMSS) will be recorded by the research assistant. For the
      assessment of the VAS score, the children will be asked to mark on a standardized data
      collection booklet, the level of their pain on a 100-mm non hatched VAS scale with at one end
      ""no pain"" and at the other ""worst pain ever"" with the following, verbatim: ""Show me on the
      line the level of your pain: here is no pain; there is the worst possible pain."" The patient
      will then cross a line to indicate his or her level of pain. All measurements will be
      recorded to the closest 1 mm.

      At time zero, the solution contained in a syringe will be administered by the on-site nurse
      to the anterior aspect of the participant's nasal cavity over few seconds. The dose (or half
      of it, if necessary) will be administered into one of the patient's nostrils with the MAD.
      The second half of the dose, if needed, will be administered in the contralateral nostril
      using the same MAD. Younger children will have the medication administered while sitting in
      the lap of a parent, with their heads reclined and necks hyperextended. Older children will
      receive the medication while lying in a semi recumbent position on the gurney. No additional
      dose would be provided. The research assistant will remain blinded to which medication the
      patient has received.

      At the fifteenth, thirtieth and sixtieth minute post-intervention, the research assistant
      will obtain a pain score via the VAS from the patient and ask for the change in their pain.
      They will be asked to give a verbal rating of their pain as 'a lot less', 'a little less',
      'the same', 'a little more' or 'a lot more' compared to the initial baseline, at time zero
      and reassess level of pain on the VAS as used previously. Children will not be permitted to
      refer to previous scales markings and will remain blinded to their prior scores. The sedation
      score will also be recorded using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) which
      overall validity was demonstrated and declared as a simple, valid and reliable tool that
      facilitates rapid and frequent assessment and documentation of depth of sedation in children.
      The vital signs will also be taken at these intervals.

      A detailed demographic and clinical data will also be collected after the study medication
      administration. A standardized questionnaire of the patient's present and past headaches,
      will be completed by the research assistant during their stay in the pediatric ED. The
      questionnaire will include questions on duration, location, description of pain, associated
      symptoms of the present headache and past medical history.

      No other meds, IV fluids, IV procedures or other painful procedures will be done during the
      study period unless the patient's condition changes or deteriorates. If any of these
      procedure is needed during the study period, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and
      will be treated according of his state of health.

      At the sixtieth minute of the study, marking the end of the study, patients who had assented
      to the study and parents will be asked to rate their satisfaction on the efficacy of the
      study medication on a Likert scale ('strongly disagree' 'disagree', 'neither agree nor
      disagree', 'agree', or 'strongly agree'). This satisfaction scale will be given to patients
      and parents after the last pain score was obtained. The study would be then completed, and
      further care will be at the discretion of the attending pediatric ED medical staff.

      A follow-up call by a research assistant will be done at 72 hours after discharge to assess
      headache recurrence, late medication side effects, and a return to another medical facility.
      All children hospitalized will also be reached.

      A chart review will be done by a member of the research team to collect final pediatric ED
      diagnosis as well as any additional investigations (e.g. CT scan, consultation with a
      neurologist, blood tests, TSH, etc.).

      Data will be collected using pediatric ED medical records of recruited patients and the
      sociodemographic questionnaire completed by a research assistant. The results of all other
      variables: VAS, UMSS and satisfaction score will be collected in real time by the research
      assistant during the pediatric ED stay.

      A data collection form will be used, and these forms will be later cross-referenced with the
      patient's clinical records by a member of the research team to verify correct documentation
      and eligibility.

      Sample size and statistics :

      This is the first study evaluating pain related to all types of headaches in children.
      Accordingly, no previous study perfectly matches our design to infer sample size. However,
      two previous studies evaluated an intervention provided to decrease acute pain secondary to
      migraine in children using the VAS. These studies reported a standard deviation of 18.5 and
      20 mm. Powell et al found the minimum clinically significant difference (MCSD) in VAS pain
      score for children aged 8 to 15 years (on a 100-mm VAS scale) to be 10 mm (95% confidence
      interval 7 to 12 mm). In studies of populations, differences of less than this amount, even
      if statistically significant, are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Previous research
      in adults has found the same MCSD in VAS pain scores and did not differ in adults with age,
      sex, or cause of pain. Based on these data, using an alpha value of 0,05 and a power of 80%,
      it was estimated that we need, 57 patients per group. Accounting to a maximal 5% drop-off
      rate, we inflated this number to 60 participants per group.

      All data will be entered in an excel database (Microsoft Inc., Richmond, WA) and will be
      analyzed with SPSS v21 (IBM Inc). The primary study analysis will be a Student's T-test to
      compare the mean differences in scores between the intervention group and the placebo group.
      An intention-to-treat approach will be used. Also, secondary analyses will be performed using
      a Student's T-test for continuous variables and a Pearson Chi-square test for categorical
      variables. The 95% confidence intervals will be measured for each result.
    ","
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who present to the
        pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches, regardless of the type, with a moderate
        or severe pain score.

        Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal to 36 mm on the VAS as
        demonstrated by Hirschfeld et. Al. This level have been chosen because it has been
        recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only be
        obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any
        treatment.

      The results of recent sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy clinical
      trials demonstrate clinically significant reductions in cardiovascular endpoints (myocardial
      infarction, cardiac death, heart failure hospitalization). SGLT2 inhibition appears to exert
      cardiovascular protection through pleiotrophic effects involving both the myocardium and
      peripheral organs but the primary pathway of risk reduction of heart failure incidents has
      not been elucidated. SGLT2 inhibitors induce a loss of 50-100 grams of glucose through
      urinary excretion daily. There is a compensatory increase in ketone body production in the
      liver after initiation of SGLT inhibition. Ketone bodies are the most energy efficient
      myocardial fuel source and reduce myocardial oxidative stress when consumed as the primary
      energy substrate. Inducing a shift to ketone body metabolism to improves cardiac diastolic
      performance suggests a unifying paradigm of direct myocardial effect and peripheral metabolic
      flexibility through which SGLT2 inhibition mediates myocardial protection in HFpEF.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: Determine if 12 weeks of SGLTi2 therapy improves peak exercise oxygen
      uptake compared to placebo. We will perform cardiac MRI exercise testing (CPET-ExMR) before
      and & post 12 weeks of therapy to measure cardiopulmonary fitness by metabolic cart gas
      exchange and left ventricular myocardial mass.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the short term (12 weeks effect of SGLTi on metabolic flexibility in HFpEF
      compared to baseline function and control group. We will measure glucose and lipid metabolism
      response to SGLT2 inhibition. Serum samples of glucose and ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate)
      will be assessed before & post 12 weeks of therapy. Serial serum samples will allow us to
      generate metabolomics profiles before and after treatment. This experimental design will
      provide insight into ketone body production, peripheral glucose flux, and circulating
      lipoparticles in response to SGLTi therapy.

      Severe influenza respiratory disease is increasingly recognized in children. Influenza
      hospitalization rates in high-risk infants, such as premature infants, are increased some
      five-fold over rates in other children. The recently-licensed live attenuated influenza
      vaccine (LAIV) promotes better immune responses than the trivalent inactivated vaccine, but
      can cause wheezing. The balance of risks and benefits for LAIV in extremely premature
      infants, who may be at increased risk for both influenza disease and vaccine side effects, is
      unknown.

      The specific aim of this project is to compare the immune response and reactions of
      trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and live, attenuated, intranasal influenza
      vaccine (LAIV) in groups of former premature (PT), very (V) LBW and former full-term (FT)
      infants aged 24-35 months.

      The investigators hypothesize that the immune response in FT infants will be greater with
      LAIV than TIV, and that wheezing episodes will be no more than twice as frequent in LAIV as
      in TIV recipients.

      The study will enroll 14 former premature, VLBW infants and 14 former full-term infants.
      Children will be randomized to receive one dose either TIV or LAIV. Vaccine reactions will be
      measured. One to two teaspoons mL of blood will be drawn at 0 and 7-14 days from

      Background. Influenza infection causes an estimated 1 million deaths worldwide yearly. Severe
      influenza respiratory disease is increasingly recognized in children. Influenza
      hospitalization rates in high-risk infants, such as premature infants, are increased some
      five-fold over rates in other children. Influenza vaccine immunogenicity is generally modest
      even in healthy children, and influenza vaccines have been incompletely studied in premature
      infants. The recently-licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is more immunogenic
      than the trivalent inactivated vaccine, but its use in infants and high risk children is
      limited by side effects. The risk/benefit ratio of LAIV in extremely premature infants, who
      may be at increased risk for both influenza disease and vaccine side effects, is unknown.

      Aim. The specific aim of this project is to compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of
      trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and live, attenuated, intranasal influenza
      vaccine (LAIV) in groups of former premature (PT), very low birth weight (VLBW) and former
      full-term (FT) infants aged 24-35 months.

      Hypotheses.

        1. The humoral immunogenicity of LAIV, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI),
           will be greater than that of TIV. This will be the co-primary outcome for this study.

        2. Vaccine reactogenicity, as measured by medically-attended wheezing episodes, will be no
           more than twice as frequent in LAIV as in TIV recipients. This will be the co-primary
           outcome for this study.

        3. Functional B-cell responses, as measured by antibody secreting cell (ASC) enzyme linked
           immunospot (ELISPOT), will be greater in LAIV-immunized infants than TIV-immunized
           infants.

        4. Peak T-cell cytokine responses, as measured by interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin
           (IL)-2 and IL-4 ELISPOT, will be greater in LAIV-immunized infants than TIV-immunized
           infants.

        5. Hemagglutinin-specific nasal immunoglobulin A (IgA) will be measureable following LAIV
           immunization.

        6. Former premature infants will have similar adaptive immune responses, but elevated
           reactogenicity to both vaccines, when compared to former full-term infants.

      Design. The study will enroll 14 former premature, VLBW infants and 14 former full-term
      infants. Subjects, who will be eligible to receive either TIV or LAIV as part of routine
      care, will be randomized to receive one dose either TIV or LAIV, according to prevailing
      recommendations for influenza immunization. Randomization will be stratified by prematurity

      immunization and questionnaires at each visit. Five to 10 mL of blood will be drawn at 0 and
      7-14 days from immunization for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and 1

      While Core Becker patient follow-up is being completed this Continued Access Study is
      designed to enroll patients at a limited rate per month to allow for continued physician and
      patient experience with the device.

      Up to 12 patients per month at sites across the United States will be enrolled in this
      research study. These patients will be implanted with the Becker 25 or Becker 50
      Expander/Breast implant and monitored for 10 years for safety.
    ",Becker Continued Access Study,Breast Reconstruction,,"
      Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in
      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A pre-market approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision subjects.
      Every subject implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, in addition to being offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects. In order to be implanted
      with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in an IDE clinical trial.

      A PMA for Mentor's MemoryGel™ Silicone Gel-Filled breast implants (which did not include the
      Becker Expander/Breast Implants) was subsequently filed with FDA in December 2003, and
      approved in November 2006 (P030053). As a condition of approval of P030053, new enrollment in
      Mentor's Adjunct Study has ceased, and women no longer have access to the Becker
      Expander/Breast Implants.

      The Mentor Becker Expander/Breast Implant was used throughout the United States during this
      time (since 1992) under the Mentor Adjunct Study to allow continued access to the device and
      to collect some safety information, however was not evaluated in the MemoryGel Core Study.
      The gel fill used in the MemoryGel implants is the same gel fill that is used for the Becker
      device.

      This protocol describes the study design procedures and population for a Continued Access
      (CA) Study for the Mentor Becker 25 and 50 Expander/Breast implants. While Core Becker
      patient follow-up is being completed, this CA Study is designed to enroll patients at a
      limited rate per month to allow for continued physician experience with the device. The
      safety data obtained may be used to provide supplemental information to the PMA. It will be
      requested that this study be initiated and renewed every six months until a final decision is
      reached regarding the Becker PMA.

      Primary Objectives:

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a multidrug versus bupivacaine
      intraoperative injection in decreasing total hip arthroplasty postoperative pain. To
      determine this, postoperative analgesic consumption will be collected for each patient and
      the value when converted to morphine equivalents will be compared between cohorts.

      Analysis of morphine equivalent values at various postoperative time intervals (0-6 hours,
      6-12 hours, 12-18, 18-24, then each postoperative day) and total morphine equivalent
      consumption for the entire length of stay will be performed between treatment cohorts.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To establish the improvement in postoperative pain relief provided by intraoperative
      periarticular injection of our multidrug protocol versus bupivacaine, other data points will
      be collected. The physical therapy milestones including time to first get out of bed, time to
      ambulation with or without assistance, time to climb stairs, and time to active straight leg
      raise will all be collected. The zero time point will be the end of the operation. Pain scale
      scores during physical therapy sessions with physiotherapists will also be recorded.

      Resting visual analog scores for pain assessment will be collected as the patient
      representing their pain on a scale from 0 to 100 mm. The VAS values will be collected at
      various postoperative time values until discharge. The length of hospital stay will be
      collected as well. Opioid side effects will also be collected including over sedation,
      respiratory depression, urinary retention, and constipation. Other data collected will
      include operation time, wound complications, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative
      drain output. At the 6 weeks postoperative visit, patient satisfaction questionnaires will be
      collected compared to preoperative visit values.

      Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) can be particularly difficult to treat as a number of
      patients do not respond to routine antibiotic or surgical treatments. The current treatment
      involves administering combination antibiotic anti-inflammatory ear drops such as Ciprodex
      (ciprofloxacin 0.3% / dexamethasone 0.1%). Although most patients experience a relief of
      symptoms, a fraction of patients remain refractory to treatment. Recent findings suggest that
      the addition of N-acetylcysteine (0.5-2%) to Ciprodex is a superior treatment for otitis
      media with effusion compared to the use of Ciprodex alone.
    ",N-Acetylcysteine as an Adjunct for Refractory Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media,"['Otitis Media', 'Otorrhea']","['Suppuration', 'Otitis Media, Suppurative', 'Otitis', 'Otitis Media']","
      Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is the presence of symptoms, signs, and physical
      findings that can result in long-term damage to the middle ear as a result of infection or
      inflammation. The condition is defined as chronic drainage from the ear, lasting longer than
      12 weeks, through a perforated tympanic membrane. Although the pathogenesis may result from
      the actions of inflammatory mediators and cytokines released following an infection, recent
      evidence also suggests that biofilm formation may be responsible for sustaining the
      inflammatory response that promotes the persistent effusion (1). These patients present a
      challenge to otolaryngologists because a number do not respond to typical oral and topical
      antibiotics.

      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant commonly used in the treatment of acetaminophen
      overdose, and has well documented mucolytic properties. In vitro, NAC has been shown to
      significantly inhibit the formation of bacterial biofilms when used alone or enhance the
      antimicrobial effects of other drugs such as ciprofloxacin (3), fosfomycin and tigecycline
      when used in combination (4-6). The application of NAC to the middle ear in patients with
      tympanostomy tubes has been shown to increase tube longevity, and decrease the replacement of
      tubes, recurrence of infection, tympanosclerosis, and subsequent physician visits (7). Recent
      findings from a case series suggest that the addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to Ciprodex
      otic solution is a superior treatment for chronic otitis media compared to Ciprodex alone
      (3). Although the practice of supplementing Ciprodex otic solution, a standard pharmacologic
      treatment for otitis media, with NAC in order to treat patients with difficult infections
      holds therapeutic promise, the efficacy of the treatment has not been objectively assessed in
      a controlled study to date in a patient population of adequate size.

      The purpose of this study will be to assess the efficacy of Ciprodex augmented with NAC
      compared to Ciprodex alone in a blinded study in subjects for whom other therapies for a
      chronically draining ear have been ineffective.

      Hypothesis:

      The cessation of otorrhea is expected to be achieved in a greater number of subjects with
      otorrhea treated with Ciprodex otic solution supplemented with NAC compared to Ciprodex
      alone. We expect that patients treated with Ciprodex augmented with NAC will experience an
      earlier cessation of symptoms and a longer duration of complete response following treatment.

      Justification:

      The current pharmacologic treatment for CSOM involves combination antibiotic
      anti-inflammatory otic drops. Ciprodex (ciprofloxacin 0.3% / dexamethasone 0.1%) has been
      shown to be safe and effective in both children and adults with ear infections. Although most
      patients experience a relief of symptoms, clinical data from various studies show 10-15%
      patients do not respond to treatment (2). Recent findings suggest that the addition of
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to Ciprodex otic solution is a superior treatment for chronic otitis
      media compared to Ciprodex alone (3).

      Objectives:

      The specific aim of this project is to compare the effect of Ciprodex otic solution alone
      with the use of Ciprodex augmented with 1.25% NAC in a randomized double-blind trial.

      Research Method:

      Patients who have experienced at least 1 month of continuous daily otorrhea despite treatment
      will be recruited from tertiary otology/neurotology clinics. Patient information, including
      previous failed interventions, duration of otorrhea, baseline audiometry, and existing
      medical conditions will be documented prior to initiating treatment.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups and instructed to
      administer 3 drops three times daily in the affected ear for 14 days. One group will use
      standard Ciprodex solution; the second group will use Ciprodex to which 0.5mL of 20% NAC was
      added to the 7.5mL bottle (final concentration 1.25%)

      Follow-up visits will be scheduled in 2 week intervals, where patients will undergo
      audiometry re-assessment and treatment progress will be monitored by history and binocular
      microscopy. Compliance to treatment will be confirmed during follow-up visits and patients
      will be provided fresh otic solution for a further 14 days if the discharge persists, to a
      maximum duration of therapy of 8 weeks. During this period patients will be assessed every 2
      weeks, as is currently the standard treatment. Potential adverse reactions such as otalgia,
      tinnitus, ear fullness, or vertigo will also be documented at each visit. After a maximum of
      8 weeks of treatment, patients who continue to experience otorrhea will undergo alternative
      treatment regimens which may include oral or topical antibiotics, or surgery. Patients who
      have been successfully treated will be monitored at 4 to 6 months to assess whether a
      complete and durable cessation of otorrhea has been achieved.

      Randomization of the drugs will be performed by the hospital site pharmacists prior to
      dispensing the solution to subjects. Random number lists will be generated and randomization
      performed in blocks of 4 through the St. Paul's Hospital Pharmacy. The Principle Investigator
      will have access to the database should an emergency situation arise.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Statistical analysis including two-tailed paired Student's t tests will be performed to
      compare the treatment duration required before patients experience a cessation of otorrhea
      for each of the two treatment groups. Thirty patients (15 per treatment group) are expected
      to be recruited for this study.

      This study is looking at a novel therapy of numbing medication injected directly around the
      fracture site. The purpose of this study is to determine if the study medication, EXPAREL®,
      is a viable alternative to current therapies for rib fractures.
    ",Exparel for Pain Control During Care of Rib Fractures,Pain,Rib Fractures,"
      Rib fractures are common in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, occurring in about
      10% of general injury cases and in about 30% of cases where the injury is directly to the
      chest. Usually caused by injury to the chest wall, rib fractures most often occur where the
      ribs bend and are most fragile. These kinds of injuries are commonly caused by motor vehicle
      collisions, falls, assault, industrial accidents, gunshots, or repetitive causes such as
      severe coughing or use-injury in athletes. With any of these types of injury, the first
      concern of the physician is to repair any immediate damage to the chest wall (such as
      penetrating wounds, air or blood in the chest cavity that compresses the lung(s), or fixing
      the broken ribs in place). Once these injuries are repaired and stabilized, the patient's
      care consists of controlling their pain and helping them recover normal breathing ability.

      In patients who are not admitted to the hospital for care, usually with only 1 or 2 ribs
      broken, care is often pain control using over the counter medicines like Tylenol or Ibuprofen
      (called NSAIDS) or prescription medicines like hydrocodone (Vicodin®). The main concern
      during follow-up of these patients is full recovery of pain-free breathing ability. In
      patients who are admitted to the hospital for treatment, pneumonia is the most common
      complication associated with multiple broken ribs. Pneumonia occurs in anywhere from 15% to
      30% of these patients. For long-acting pain control to help them breathe more easily, studies
      have shown that epidural analgesia (pain relieving drugs delivered through a thin tube called
      a catheter into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord) is preferable over opioids, whether
      given in pill form or through an IV. Additional studies have shown better results with
      epidural pain control compared to opioid or NSAID use. However, with all of these methods
      come risks and side effects.

      Using oral NSAIDs can result in stomach irritation, kidney injury, or can interfere with the
      body's ability to form blood clots. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) has been shown to be toxic to the
      liver at higher doses. Opioid use can lower a person's breathing ability even while it
      reduces their pain, which is not wanted in patients already at higher risk for pneumonia.
      Epidural placement is a complex procedure, risks infection at the site of catheter insertion,
      can cause itching, and risks injury to both the spinal cord and the membrane surrounding it
      (the dura).

      Nicotine dependence has not been sufficiently addressed in current state-of-the-science
      cessation interventions for pregnant smokers. The weight of the evidence from the general
      population of smokers suggests that nicotine replacement therapies may be beneficial
      cessation aids for pregnant smokers who are unable to stop smoking. The tremendous potential
      of these therapies for promoting smoking cessation among pregnant women creates a pressing
      need for decision tools and protocols to encourage treatment adherence that is essential for
      rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of OTC NRT when provided as part of prenatal care.
      The results of this research could be directly translated to the improvement of obstetrical
      care providers' clinical practices. Medically supervised use of OTC NRT by pregnant smokers
      is an alternative to continued smoking that has the potential to substantially increase rates
      of smoking cessation during pregnancy.
    ",Testing Pharmacological Therapies for Pregnant Smokers,"['Smoking', 'Pregnancy']",,"
      The proposed five-year study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of providing
      over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy, choice of gum, lozenge or patch, (NRT)
      to promote prepartum smoking cessation. Proposed is a two-arm design. Eligible pregnant women
      (N=300) will be randomized to either: Arm 1, Tailored Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (TCBT,
      n=100) that provides women with customized risk information about smoking and nicotine, the
      potential harms to the fetus and encouragement of appropriate behavioral skills building; or
      Arm 2, TCBT + NRT - the tailored intervention incorporating NRT information plus choice of
      patch or gum (n=200). The intervention will include 5 face-to-face contacts as part of
      prenatal visits and 1 telephone counseling session. Primary outcome measures will be
      biochemically validated 7-day prevalent abstinence rates at the 19-27th and 29-37th week of
      pregnancy. Secondary outcomes will include 7-day prevalent abstinence rates at 12 weeks
      postpartum, serious quit attempts, compliance with NRT, and use of materials. Saliva cotinine
      will be measured among all women at baseline, the 27-35th week of pregnancy, and 12 weeks
      postpartum. The significance of this project is that it relies on transdisciplinary
      collaborations to extend the science in nicotine replacement therapies to a population that
      could derive substantial health benefits. Moreover, the study results have immediate
      potential to inform clinical recommendations for integrating nicotine replacement into

      The purpose of this study is to compare how safe, tolerable, and effective a novel drug,
      raltegravir, is to a commonly used combination, atazanavir/ritonavir, as initial treatment in
      HIV/Hepatitis C co-infected injecting drug users on a methadone program.
    ","Safety and Efficacy Study Comparing Raltegravir to a Protease Inhibitor in Treatment-naïve, HIV/Hepatitis C Drug Users","['HIV Infections', 'Hepatitis C']","['Hepatitis A', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis']","
      Raltegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor that is currently licensed for use in
      treatment-experienced HIV-1 patients and recently approved for use in treatment-naïve
      patients. Recent data has shown that the virologic response in patients on raltegravir with
      no history of antiretroviral treatment (ART) was equal to efavirenz-based therapy at 96-weeks
      (combined with tenofovir/lamivudine). Moreover, raltegravir demonstrated greater immunologic
      effect, had fewer adverse side effects and had a neutral effect on lipid levels. Further
      support for first-line use comes from recent 48-week data of a subgroup analyses of the
      STARTMRK Phase III study comparing raltegravir to efavirenz-based therapy (with
      tenofovir/emtricitabine) in treatment-naïve patients that showed non-inferior virologic and
      immunologic efficacy with raltegravir. There were significantly fewer overall and
      drug-related clinical adverse events in the raltegravir group and a similar safety profile in
      patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection. These findings suggest that use of
      raltegravir as a component of initial therapy might be beneficial in patients with
      significant co-morbidities such as hepatitis C and in situations where there is concern of
      interactions between antiretrovirals and other drugs.

      Injecting drug users (IDUs) represent a patient group where there are formidable challenges
      in HIV treatment. Difficulties in management arise not only from substance abuse but also
      because of high rates of social instability and psychiatric co-morbidities. Furthermore, many
      in this patient group have hepatitis C co-infection. These confounding factors negatively
      impact adherence to, and ultimately the efficacy of treatment and can affect physician
      perception when prescribing antiretrovirals. Concurrent methadone therapy further complicates
      HIV treatment because of its potential side effects and interactions with antiretrovirals.
      However, methadone maintenance therapy also represents an important opportunity to engage
      patients in consistent medical care and has been shown to improve adherence to antiretroviral
      treatment and thus viral suppression.

      The incidence of co-infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in IDUs is high. An
      estimated 50-90% of IDUs in the U.S. are co-infected with HIV/Hepatitis C according to the
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV co-infection aggravates the natural course of
      HCV infection. In a meta-analysis of the effect of HIV on the progression of HCV liver
      disease compared to mono-infection with HCV, the relative risk of end-stage liver disease
      (ESLD) and cirrhosis with HIV co-infection was found to be 6.14 and 2.07, respectively.
      Difficulties arise in the treatment of HIV with respect to HCV liver disease. Drug
      hepatotoxicity is a major concern in the selection of an appropriate antiretroviral regimen.
      Optimising therapy in this patient group necessitates a balance between retroviral
      suppression and minimising hepatic side effects.

      Raltegravir is predominantly metabolised by hepatic glucuronidation via the uridine
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) isozyme. A small component is renally
      excreted (~9%). In three double-blind, randomised studies of pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability, raltegravir was found to be rapidly absorbed with a terminal half-life of 7-12
      hours. It exhibited potent in vitro inhibition with a 95% inhibitory concentration (IC95) =
      33nM in 50% human serum. Pharmacokinetic analyses of various dosing regimens supported the
      use of twice daily dosing of multiple doses of 100mg and greater. Results from a study
      investigating once daily dosing are pending.

      Hepatic impairment is less likely to affect UGT1A1 metabolism in comparison to other liver
      metabolic pathways. A recent study evaluated the effect of liver impairment on raltegravir
      pharmacokinetics in 20 HIV-negative patients (ten patients with moderate hepatic
      insufficiency and ten healthy, matched controls). The geometric mean ratios (GMR: mean value
      for the group with moderate hepatic insufficiency/mean value for the healthy controls) and
      90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero
      to infinity (AUC0- ∞ ), the maximum concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax), and the
      concentration at 12 h (C12) were 0.86 (90% CI, 0.41, 1.77), 0.63 (90% CI, 0.23, 1.70), and
      1.26 (90% CI, 0.65, 2.43), respectively. The study authors determined that liver impairment
      produced no clinically significant effects on raltegravir pharmacokinetics and therefore no
      dose adjustments are needed for mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency.

      Protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir, are extensively metabolised via hepatic cytochrome
      P450 (CYP) 3A isozymes. In patients with hepatic insufficiency, dose adjustments of PIs or
      consideration of alternative therapies may be necessary. Atazanavir is also a potent
      inhibitor of CYP3A and therefore has a potential to cause drug interactions .

      Concerns regarding adverse cardiac effects of antiretroviral therapy have recently emerged.
      Protease inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction that
      is partially due to dyslipidaemia. Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir is commonly used as part of
      combination treatment in IDUs because of its modest effect on lipid levels and also due to
      the simplicity of once daily dosing. However, it has other associated risk factors and
      intolerability due to hyperbilirubinaemia is also an issue.

      There is also growing concern with reports of long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes in
      IDUs. This patient group have several risk factors that increase their susceptibility.
      Methadone is well recognised to cause long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes through
      inhibition of a cardiac potassium channel, the major component of which is encoded by the
      human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG). Multiple HERG polymorphisms have been identified that are
      clinically silent but may confer vulnerability to arrhythmia by a triggering event. Protease
      inhibitors also have the potential to cause QT prolongation. This may be mediated by direct
      effects on HERG channels or by potentiating the effects of other drugs through inhibition of
      CYP3A, or both. Concurrent use of protease inhibitors and methadone might pose an additive
      risk of QT prolongation and a few cases have been reported recently. Additionally,
      co-infection with hepatitis C is also recognised to prolong the QT interval.

      Raltegravir has been shown to have no effect on the QT interval in a single, supratherapeutic
      dose in humans and in multiple doses in an animal model. It also exhibits negligible
      inhibition of HERG current in vitro and has been found to have little to no effect on
      cytochrome P450 enzymes.

      In summary, efficacious virologic and immunologic response, safe use in hepatic impairment,
      non-inhibition of CYP enzymes, lack of QT effect, and favourable lipid and side effect
      profile indicate that raltegravir could be a preferred option for first-line treatment in
      this patient group.

      This study will be carried out as a Phase 4, Multi-Centre Open Label, Investigator Led,
      Randomised Pilot Study to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of raltegravir
      (Isentress™) with protease inhibitor-based therapy atazanavir/ritonavir (Reyataz™/Norvir™) in
      treatment naïve, HIV/Hepatitis C co-infected injecting drug users receiving methadone.
      Patients who are attending a drug treatment clinic, who are on methadone maintenance therapy,
      who fulfill standard criteria to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who meet all other
      study specific eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study.

      Eligible patients, who are willing to participate in the study and who agree to comply with
      all study treatments and procedures, will be randomized to treatment with either:

        1. Raltegravir 400mg PO twice daily; or

        2. Atazanavir/ritonavir 300mg/100mg PO once daily over a 96 week treatment period.

      As per the recommended guidelines, both treatment regimes will be combined with a nucleoside
      reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of tenofovir and emtricitabine, but can be
      changed due to toxicities as per the discretion of the investigator or other medically
      qualified designee.

      The total study duration for subjects completing the entire study will be approximately 100
      weeks. During this time subjects will attend the clinic for 11 study visits at Baseline,
      Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 and an End of Study Visit, 4 weeks post completion
      of treatment.

      Subjects' participation in this study will end following the End of Study Visit (or early
      withdrawal visit if applicable). Once subjects have completed their participation in this
      study they will be treated as per routine standard care for this patient population.

      Written informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures being conducted.
      Patients will have an initial baseline assessment prior to treatment initiation. This will
      include a medical history, physical examination and electrocardiogram. Baseline laboratory
      tests will include a resistance profile, CD4 count, viral load, hepatitis C status, full
      blood count, liver blood tests and renal profile.

      Patients will be re-assessed at 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 weeks post initiation
      for treatment efficacy, safety, tolerability and compliance. Follow-up blood tests will be
      drawn to assess virological and immunological response to treatment as well as routine blood
      tests to detect hepatitis C status, liver/renal toxicities and haematological abnormalities.
      ECG evaluation for QT abnormalities will be performed at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, 48 and
      96. A follow up safety visit will be conducted 4 weeks post completion of therapy. Monitoring
      for adverse events will take place throughout the study period and continuity of care, as per
      standard medical care for this patient population, maintained after the patients have
      completed the study at the respective sites.

      Background : Epidural anaesthesia is associated in abdominal surgery with reduced pain and
      postoperative respiratory complications together with quicker recovery of bowel function.
      Currently, no studies have been able to prove its ability to reduce length of stay in
      intensive care and high-dependency units.

      Purpose : The aim of this study is to demonstrate that epidural anaesthesia reduces length of
      stay in intensive care unit after abdominal surgery under laparotomy.

      There are currently two methods of analgesia in postoperative abdominal surgery :
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids and epidural analgesia.

      No international recommendations regarding the use of either of these techniques have yet
      been written. Epidural analgesia is superior to intravenous morphine, including during
      mobilization and coughing. It also reduces respiratory complications and optimizes
      postoperative rehabilitation. Nevertheless, mortality is not improved with this technique.
      Few publications exist on the optimization of the duration of hospitalization in the
      intensive care unit.

      This will be a randomized controlled unblinded pragmatic single-center pilot trial of the use

    ",Angiotensin II vs. Vasopressin in Septic Shock,Septic Shock,"['Shock, Septic', 'Shock']","
      Sepsis affects >1 million Americans yearly and, when septic shock ensues, is associated with
      high morbidity and mortality. Though first-line norepinephrine is standard of care, there are
      limited prospective data to guide the choice of additional vasopressors in septic shock.
      While more studies are needed, preliminary data suggest that the vasopressor angiotensin II
      (AngII) may improve outcomes in septic shock.

      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing AngII (intervention) and
      vasopressin (standard of care) as second-line vasopressors in septic shock. The goal is to
      demonstrate feasibility of a large multicenter RCT and eventually to demonstrate that AngII
      use improves important endpoints (e.g., mortality, need for organ support) in all or certain
      subsets of patients with septic shock.

      Furthermore, there are no biomarkers currently available and validated to guide the choice of
      vasopressor therapy in septic shock. In this study the investigators will investigate serum
      renin as such a biomarker. Renin has been shown in preliminary studies to accurately predict
      mortality in septic shock, outperforming lactate, and to predict beneficial response to
      AngII. The investigators aim to validate the use of renin as a biomarker in septic shock and
      prove its utility in guiding vasopressor selection, with the goal of incorporating renin
      levels at specified time points and/or change in renin levels into an algorithm used to
      select patients for AngII therapy in the subsequent large multicenter RCT.

      The primary rationale for this study is to develop an optimized schedule of administration of
      FOLFOX + bevacizumab that maximizes the efficacy and safety of this regimen when administered
      to patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The hypothesis is that the use of an
      intermittent oxaliplatin (IO) schedule of FOLFOX/bevacizumab will allow these patients to
      continue on treatment for a longer period of time by reducing the proportion of patients who
      discontinue therapy early because of treatment-related toxicities and thus increasing the
      possibility of a longer time to progression.

      The primary objective is:

        -  To test the hypothesis that an intermittent oxaliplatin (IO) schedule of
           FOLFOX/bevacizumab will allow patients to remain on therapy for a longer period of time
           compared to a conventional ""treat-to-failure"" schedule, by reducing the proportion of
           patients who discontinue therapy for treatment-related toxicities.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the impact of calcium/magnesium infusions on the incidence and severity of
           neurotoxicity in subjects receiving either the IO or conventional FOLFOX/bevacizumab
           treatment schedules as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.

      This study evaluates 20% n-acetylcystine (NAC) in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma

      7-day treatment period and placebo in the next 7-day treatment period; and the other half

      period.
    ",Clinical Trial of NAC in Asthma,Asthma,Asthma,"
      n-acetylcystine (NAC) is a mucolytic medication, meaning that it breaks apart mucus.
      Investigators know that mucus is a factor in severe asthma attacks. However, mucus may be a
      factor in chronic severe asthma as well. This role has been hard to prove because of
      difficulty in showing that mucus occludes the lumen in chronic severe disease. Using a novel
      approach of scoring mucus occlusion, investigators have used CT imaging to uncover that a
      majority of people with severe asthma have at least one lung segment with a mucus plug and
      27% have more than four lung segments with mucus plugs.

      Historically, studies of mucolytics, like NAC, have not shown benefit in other obstructive
      lung diseases, like COPD. However, utilizing CT mucus scores as a biomarker, investigators
      believe that mucolytic treatment may prove useful for those with significant mucus impaction.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 study of 20% NAC in patients
      with asthma who also have evidence of mucus in their lungs as determined by CT imaging.
      Investigators hypothesize that by treating asthmatics, chosen based on the presence of mucus
      in the airways, with a mucolytic like NAC, will result in an improvement of lung function.

      Growing evidence suggests that dopamine contributes to key cognitive, emotional, and motor
      functions across the lifespan. In Late-Life Depression (LLD), dysfunction in these areas is
      common, predicts poor outcomes, and manifests as difficulties in motivation and effort along
      with cognitive and gait impairment. While studies of dopamine function in early and midlife
      depression primarily focus on individuals' ability to feel pleasure and respond to rewards,
      they often exclude the cognitive and physical function domains relevant for older adults
      despite a recognized decline in dopamine function with normal aging. The objectives of this
      collaborative R01 proposal between Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute
      and Vanderbilt University Medical Center are to: 1) characterize dopaminergic dysfunction in
      LLD across cognitive, emotional, and motor domains at several levels of analysis (cellular
      Positron Emission Tomography [PET], circuit Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI], and behavioral
      / self-report); and 2) examine the responsivity of dopamine-related circuits and behavior to
      stimulation with carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA).
    ",1/2-Dopaminergic Dysfunction in Late-Life Depression (The D3 Study),"['Depression', 'Cognitive Impairment', 'Gait Impairment']","['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder']","
      Supported by pilot data, this project builds on past work demonstrating that dopamine
      function declines with aging, that dopaminergic dysfunction contributes to deficits in
      behavior, and that L-DOPA administration improves cognitive and motor performance. The
      long-term goal of this line of research is to determine how dopaminergic dysfunction
      contributes to clinical presentations of LLD, how responsive behavioral symptoms are to
      modulation of dopamine function, and to identify novel targets for future interventions.
      Investigator's approach is to enroll 30 psychiatrically healthy elders and 60 depressed
      elders at Columbia/NYSPI exhibiting either slowed processing speed or slowed gait speed.
      Participants will undergo thorough clinical evaluations and complete PET imaging measuring
      different aspects of the brain's dopamine system, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI measurement of
      longterm dopamine transmission, functional MRI focused on effort-based decision making and
      reward processing, a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, a physical performance
      evaluation, and measurement of inflammatory markers. To assess responsivity of the dopamine
      system to modulation, depressed subjects then will be randomized to L-DOPA or placebo for 3
      weeks, followed by repeat multimodal MRI and cognitive/behavioral assessments. In a second
      phase, participants will receive the opposite intervention for an additional 3 weeks followed
      by clinical and cognitive assessments only. This proposal is significant and innovative, as
      no prior published study has comprehensively examined dopamine-dependent behaviors in LLD.
      This will inform treatment approaches focusing on facilitating cognition and movement,
      reducing the effort cost of voluntary behavior, and promoting behavioral activation.

    ",Effective Pain Management During Shoulder Replacement Surgery With EXPAREL,"['Pain, Postoperative', 'Shoulder Osteoarthritis']","Pain, Postoperative","
      Shoulder replacement surgery is recognized as having the potential to cause a considerable
      amount of pain that may require opioid consumption for several days post-operatively. The
      side effects of opioids are numerous, and ropivacaine administered pre-operatively via
      interscalene nerve block, with a post-operative continuous ropivacaine infusion through an
      indwelling catheter (CINB) is a highly effective method for controlling pain and reducing
      opioid consumption and side effects. While CINB provides adequate post-operative analgesia,
      and may extend post-operative pain relief for up to 48 hours, there are some risks associated
      with CINB ranging from catheter tip withdrawal to more serious complications including
      catheter tip beakage, brachial plexus injury, and pulmonary complications. Local infiltration
      of liposomal bupivacaine (EXPAREL Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, New Jersey) may
      provide longer-lasting pain relief when compared to single shot INB (SSINB), and reduce
      opioid consumption at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours post-op. Studies have shown
      inconsistency in the effectiveness of EXPAREL, and one proposed reason is the method of
      administration. Clinicians experienced in their infiltration technique demonstrated greater
      improvement in pain-related outcomes. The first 48 hours post-op present the most likely
      opportunity for reducing narcotic administration, which increases the value of attempting to
      reduce opioid consumption during this period. The cost of EXPAREL LIA, is slightly less than
      the cost of CINB, and if pain control is comparable, may benefit the patient in reducing
      hospital costs. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of pain control of
      local infiltration of EXPAREL administration to ropivacaine administered via continuous

      In patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving dialysis, the risk of
      cardiovascular death has been estimated to be 10-100 times higher than the general population
      without renal disease. This is due in part to high levels of inflammation and vascular
      calcification (large deposits of calcium in arteries) found in these patients. Chronic
      inflammation is particularly common in patients with ESRD. Parenteral iron therapy, which is
      common in patients on dialysis, may contribute to this inflammation and also a higher
      cardiovascular risk. Phosphate binders, particularly non-calcium based phosphate binders, may
      decrease cardiovascular risk by decreasing inflammation and vascular calcification. In a
      study of 10,044 hemodialysis patients, treatment with a phosphate binder was associated with
      improved survival. Ferric citrate a non-calcium based phosphate binder with approximately 210

      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most performed and efficacious orthopaedic
      procedures, with an estimated 7 million people living with a total knee prosthesis in 2010.1
      The number of annual TKAs is predicted to increase by 85% by 2030 and 143% by 2050, equating
      to 1.26 million2 and 1.5 million3 procedures per year, respectively. In recent studies, knee
      prostheses have demonstrated their efficacy in 10-, 20-, and 25-year survival rates of 96.1%,
      89.7%4, and 82.3%5, respectively. Similarly, comparing functional and patient-reported
      outcomes before and after surgery have confirmed the high success rate achieved with this
      procedure.6-10 However, recovery following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the acute
      postoperative period is variable. Most clinical improvements are achieved within the first
      three months postoperatively but can continue up to one year.11 There is currently a paucity
      of data evaluating the efficacy of oral corticosteroids in the six-week to three-month
      postoperative period in slowly recovering patients.

      Few treatments have been studied for patients who fail to achieve early range of motion or
      pain reduction milestones in the perioperative period. Periarticular and systemic
      corticosteroids improve pain and function in the immediate postoperative period, without an
      increase in adverse events.12-16 Additional doses of corticosteroids administered at 24 and
      48 hours postoperatively have demonstrated greater improvements in pain and ROM compared to
      perioperative administration, with no difference in complication rates.17-20 However, few
      studies have evaluated the use of oral corticosteroids within a multimodal pain management
      regimen. Gardiner et al. evaluated low-dose steroids 10 days immediately following lumbar
      laminectomy and/or discectomy, in addition to a standard opioid regimen, and reported
      decreased subjective pain scores.21 Gottshalk et al. reported decreased patient reported pain
      from postoperative days 4-7 in early published results of a randomized controlled trial
      investigating administration of a methylprednisolone taper immediately following distal
      radius repair.22 Importantly, the current literature demonstrates low- and short-dose
      corticosteroids are safe.23 Intraoperative corticosteroids have been shown to improve pain
      and function in the acute postoperative period, and additional doses in the immediate
      postoperative period can potentiate and prolong this beneficiary effect, without increasing
      adverse events. Therefore, a methylprednisolone taper six weeks post-TKA may benefit patients
      experiencing decreased ROM or delayed recovery, including residual pain.

      Following TKA, care is taken to control pain, swelling, and stiffness, all of which may
      contribute to delayed recovery. For instance, more than 20% of TKA patients develop
      postoperative stiffness,24 known as arthrofibrosis, accounting for an estimated 28% of 90-day
      hospital readmissions.25 In treating patients with delayed recovery, corticosteroids are of
      particular interest because of its potent anti-inflammatory effect, evidenced by its ability
      to decrease postoperative levels of IL-6 and CRP.15 Corticosteroids block prostaglandin
      synthesis, which is responsible for sensitizing nociceptive pain receptors, and reduce
      vascular permeability, which causes edema following surgery.26, 27 Therefore, by reducing
      pain and edema, corticosteroids may allow for more effective physical therapy sessions and
      more rapid improvement in ROM and recovery following TKA.

      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the utility of a
      methylprednisolone taper six weeks to three months postoperatively following TKA. The authors
      present a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial evaluating the role of a
      methylprednisolone taper on patients with decreased ROM or delayed recovery in the acute
      postoperative period.

      Glomerulonephritis and renal failure represent one of the most life-threatening
      manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although immunosuppressive therapy is
      often effective for the treatment of acute lupus nephritis, a significant proportion of
      patients show persistent proteinuria after resolution of the acute nephritic process, and
      develop progressive renal failure. There is preliminary evidence that calcitriol and other
      vitamin D analogs can reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney diseases. The
      investigators plan to conduct a randomized control study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of calcitriol in the treatment of SLE patients with persistent proteinuria. Sixty patients
      with clinically quiescent SLE and persistent proteinuria despite conventional therapy will be
      recruited. They will be treated with calcitriol for 48 weeks. Proteinuria, renal function,
      lupus disease activity, serum and urinary inflammatory markers will be monitored. This study
      will explore the potential anti-proteinuric and immunomodulating effects of calcitriol in the

      Fungal infections continue to be a source of serious morbidity and mortality in liver
      transplant patients. Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome ®) has been shown in animals to be
      concentrated in the liver, lungs and leukocytes. It also has a long half-like making it a
      potentially attractive drug for prophylaxis in liver transplantation (OLT).

      We propose to administer a single (5mg/kg) dose of AmBisome ® following reperfusion of the
      new liver. Liver, subcutaneous fat, blood and bile samples will be analyzed for AMB levels
      1-2 hours after drug administration. Blood and bile, and body fluid samples will be
      sequentially analyzed for 3 weeks post transplant. This will be done in 50 consecutive
      patients. The incidence of fungal infections and adverse effects will be monitored for three
      months.

      Persistent AMB levels in blood bile and ascites, if found, will provide a good rationale for
      AmBisome ® prophylaxis for fungal infections in outpatients.

      Aim of this project is to customize the choice of the strong opioid in the treatment of
      cancer chronic pain through the identification of patient clinical history and pain
      characteristics, moreover in the analysis the investigators will also correlate the clinical
      efficacy and safety of opioid treatment with pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic patterns in
      order to identify variables able to predict the efficacy of the treatment or the patient
      susceptibility towards a specific treatment.

      Furthermore with this study the investigators want to identify the pharmacogenomic
      characterization responsible for pharmacokinetic variability in the conversion between
      morphine and other opioids, in order to validate the currently available conversion tables
      from a pharmacokinetic viewpoint, estimating the influence of the most common genetic
      polymorphisms, and if this characterization could be useful and cost-effective. This study
      will also focus on the specific clinical-pharmacological response in the elderly and between
      male and female and on the interactions between opioids and those anticonvulsant and
      antidepressant drugs routinely used in the pain therapy (study of pharmacovigilance).
    ",Prospective Study About Clinical and Pharmacogenetic Safety of Opioid Use for Chronic Pain,Chronic Pain,Chronic Pain,"
      Pain continues to be a major problem in patients with cancer, affecting 25% to 30% of
      patients with recently diagnosed cancers. The incidence of pain in advanced stages of cancer
      approaches 70% to 80%. There are a number of reasons that patients with cancer experience
      chronic pain either related to the disease itself or to its treatment.

      Cancer can spread by metastasis or direct invasion, and 90% of patients with metastasis to
      osseous structures report pain. Patients with cancer can have neuropathic pain due to direct
      compression of nerves or plexus or spinal cord involvement.

      Inadequate treatment and undertreatment are associated with increased pain scores, decreased
      functional ability, and increased depression and anxiety.

      Opioid administration though proven to be effective still meets with resistance from both
      healthcare operators, who are seldom willing to prescribe these drugs, and patients, who tend
      to not take them because of many false beliefs still related to opioids.

      It is well demonstrated by the literature that opioids are effective in controlling both
      acute and chronic pain of nociceptive and/or neuropathic origin. Switching type of opioid
      and/or administration routes (e.g., from oral to neuraxial) is also known to be an important
      factor in long-term treatment: appropriate conversion tables elucidating drug equipotence and
      different potency in base of administration route for the different opioids currently
      available have therefore been devised and validated in the clinical setting.

      There have been several attempts to define guidelines for treatment protocols and even recent
      meta-analyses indicate that morphine should remain the gold standard. However, a general
      consensus is still lacking, as opioid management depends not only on the type and cause of
      pain, but also on the patient's history, the pain characteristics and genetic patterns.
      Which, if any, is the best opioid, in relation with previous characters, to start systemic
      treatment remains therefore debated. The different effects that different opioids have on
      spinal cord sensitization as a result of continuous peripheral nociceptive stimulus in long
      term administration have also been partially investigated.

      Current pharmacogenetic publications analyze the pharmacokinetic behavior of opioids in
      short-term administration, but studies are still lacking on how the pharmacokinetics and
      analgesic effect vary after repeated administrations of opioids, especially through direct
      comparison with clinical response. Genetic studies showed differences in the results of
      opioid treatment related to the variability of the genes that have a role in the
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics of opioids. Regardless these studies, the literature has
      not yet investigated how quantitative and qualitative variability of gene products can
      influence the efficacy or the toxicity of a specific opioid treatment.

      To describe laryngeal and respiratory reflex responses after controlled laryngeal stimulation
      in pediatric patients anesthetized with sevoflurane and to compare the evoked responses at
      two levels of anesthesia. To determine whether laryngeal and respiratory reflex responses
      after controlled laryngeal stimulation are completely suppressed in subjects when
      anesthetized with a MACEI95 (EI = endotracheal intubation) sevoflurane Hypothesis: The
      incidence of apnea with laryngospasm evoked by laryngeal stimulation will be reduced by 20%
      (from 25% to 5%) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane is increased from 2.5%
      (MAC50) to 4.7% (MACEI95)
    ",Sevoflurane and Laryngeal Reflex Responses in Pediatric Patients,Laryngospasm,Laryngismus,"
      Induction of anesthesia inhaling sevoflurane is a very common practice in pediatric
      anesthesia.However, unwarranted exaggerated upper airway defensive reflexes that develop into
      apnea and laryngospasm with resultant hypoxemia is more common and also more severe.

      Despite their obvious clinical significance, reflexes that involve the function of the upper
      airway are only minimally understood and information on such reflexes is scarce in
      anesthetized humans. Nonetheless, a model was developed by analyzing respiratory variables
      and endoscopic images after stimulating the laryngeal mucosa with a small amount of distilled
      water. Clinical experience suggests that laryngeal reflexes occur more frequently under light
      levels of anesthesia. However, in contrast to other inhalational agents such as halothan,
      available data for sevoflurane suggest that an inverse correlation of laryngeal
      responsiveness to depth of hypnosis or end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane (in adults and
      children) is less obvious. However, in all previous studies assessing laryngeal reflex
      responses under sevoflurane only low concentrations of sevoflurane (range of 1.0 - 2.5 Vol%)
      were examined. This is an important limitation because in clinical practice higher
      concentrations of sevoflurane are used, especially during manipulation of the airway, while
      the risk of airway irritation is high. Thus, the proposed study aims to explore the question
      whether the occurrence of laryngospasm can be reliably suppressed when high concentrations of
      sevoflurane are used.

      Based on results of experiments assessing conditions that facilitate tracheal intubation, it
      is clear, that increasing the end-tidal concentration of volatile agents obtunds airway
      reflexes. Regarding intubation conditions, the concept of MACEI 50% or 95% describes the
      minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of a volatile anesthetic needed by 50 or 95% of the
      patients, respectively, to prevent all movement during and immediately after tracheal
      intubation. The proposed study aims to assess respiratory reflex responses at these levels of
      anesthesia by analyzing the respiratory variables and endoscopic images. The incidences of
      well-defined airway reflexes (cough reflex, spasmodic panting, expiration reflex, and apnea
      with laryngospasm, central apnea) will be examined. Apnea with laryngospasm will be of
      primary interest in our study and digital video analysis of the glottic opening will allow
      for a detailed analysis of laryngeal performance.

      INTRODUCTION: There is an important need for inexpensive drugs that treat neuropathic pain.
      Early research suggests that methadone may be a good, inexpensive drug to treat neuropathic
      pain. Methadone is available in a low cost powder that is easily prepared for different
      routes of administration. This study will look at the effect and safety of methadone compared
      to the regular treatment of morphine for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

      OBJECTIVES: First the investigators want to determine if methadone is effective and safe for
      the treatment of neuropathic pain. Since a placebo control group would be unethical, the
      proposed comparator will consist of the ""gold standard"" conventional treatment, controlled
      release morphine. The investigators will compare methadone to controlled-release morphine
      with regard to how it affects the level of pain and extent of side effects. Next the
      investigators want to examine safety as well as to determine whether methadone leads to
      improvements in physical and emotional functioning, and participants' satisfaction with the
      treatment.

      METHODS: A double blind, randomized trial comparing methadone and controlled release morphine
      is proposed. After 1-week, participants will be randomly assigned to either methadone or
      controlled release morphine and will gradually build to a dose at which they receive adequate
      pain relief without unacceptable levels of side effects. This 5-week phase will be followed
      by a 6-week dose phase and then a 4-week tapering off phase.

      Study drug: The study drug is methadone supplied in 2.5 mg tablets. The comparator will
      consist of controlled release morphine in 10 mg tablets. The dose of each will range from
      1-12 tablets taken every 12 hours (dose ranges methadone 5-60 mg/day, controlled release
      morphine 20-240 mg/day).

      Setting: This is a 3-site study involving pain clinics in Halifax, Nova Scotia; London,
      Ontario; and Calgary, Alberta.

      ""Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DHB) inhibition represents a promising approach to treating
      cocaine dependence. DBH is the enzyme responsible for hydroxylation of dopamine into
      noradrenaline. Its inhibition suppresses noradrenaline secretion. In animal studies, the
      efficacy of DBH inhibition in psychostimulants use could be linked to a reduced dopaminergic
      response, possibly in association with post synaptic dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity.
      In humans, the clinical efficacy of DBH inhibition, in particular following disulfiram
      administration, is in the process of being established. However, its particular mode of
      action remains unclear: some publications suggest an increased aversive reaction to cocaine,
      whereas others report decreased positive effects. To date, the impact of DBH inhibition on
      dopaminergic response to psychostimulants has yet to be studied in humans.

      This study represents a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial. Thirty cocaine
      dependant patients will be included in this study during their hospitalization for
      withdrawal. After the inclusion visit, they will be randomized to receive disulfiram 250

      evaluated during two TEP imaging sessions with 11Craclopride, before and after stimulation by
      methylphenidate, 8 to 15 days after randomization. The main outcome criterion will be the
      variations in linkage rates of 11Craclopride in the nucleus accumbens between baseline TEP
      measurement and TEP measurement following administration of 20 mg of methylphenidate.

      The primary objective of this trial is to show that in abstinent cocaine patients, DBH
      inhibition by disulfiram induces reduced dopaminergic response following methylphenidate
      administration. The secondary objectives of this trial are:

        1. to show that methylphenidate stimulation induces less craving and more aversive
           responses in the disulfiram vs placebo condition;

        2. to show that DBH inhibition by disulfiram elevates D2 dopaminergic receptor availability
           (in the absence of methylphenidate stimulation);

        3. to show that the availability of D2 dopaminergic receptors (in the absence of
           methylphenidate stimulation) is linked to DBH activity;

        4. to confirm that in abstinent cocaine patients, disulfiram reduces DBH activity vs
           placebo;

        5. to confirm that subjects with weak DBH activity have more aversive reactions to cocaine.

      Currently, disulfiram is the only drug on the market that inhibits DBH. Another more specific
      DBH inhibitor is currently under development. It is possible that other inhibitors could soon
      be developed by the pharmaceutical industry in the area of psychoactive drug addiction or
      other psychiatric or somatic disorders. The development of this new therapeutic approach
      requires a better understanding of its action mechanism.

      The aim of the study is to test whether, in patients with angina and flow limiting epicardial

      We will be recruiting patients with stable angina referred for percutaneous intervention
      (PCI) due to flow limiting coronary artery disease. All patients will be on an existing beta
      blocker prescription (standard first line angina therapy). Our hypothesis is that Ivabradine
      will attenuate microvascular dysfunction post PCI when compared to standard beta-blocker
      pre-treatment. We intend to test this in a randomised, open-label parallel arm study with a
      direct comparison between Ivabradine and beta-blockers (standard therapy). Patients will be
      randomised to receive either Ivabradine (and stop beta blockers) or continue beta blockers
      for 6 weeks prior to the PCI procedure. The primary endpoint will be IMR (index of
      microvascular resistance) post PCI, as a marker of microvascular dysfunction and procedural
      related myocardial injury. IMR is a potent marker of adverse outcome in STEMI patients and in
      ACS after PCI. Although this has yet to be assessed in the elective setting, a reduction in
      IMR with Ivabradine may indicate a potential to improve outcomes and lessen iatrogenic
      microvascular dysfunction post PCI. IMR is assessed using thermodilution catheters placed
      distal to the coronary stenosis and by producing hyperaemia. To assess the medium term
      effects on the microcirculation post PCI all patients will have a stress perfusion cardiac
      MRI 12 weeks post procedure. The secondary endpoint will be proportion of patients with
      coronary flow reserve (CFR) <2.0 in PCI territory (regional myocardial blood flow at
      hyperaemia by intravenous adenosine infusion compared to rest). We will also be assessing CFI
      (collateral flow index), as promotion of the collateral system is one method by which
      Ivabradine may lessen procedural related myocardial injury, and ΔIMR as the difference
      between IMR pre and post-PCI.

      Accumulating evidence suggests that the natriuretic peptide (NP) hormonal system has

      cardiovascular and metabolic benefits), and reduced fat accumulation. Although recent studies
      in rodents suggest that NPs have important metabolic effects, there are few prospective data
      on the metabolic effects of NPs in humans.

      Therefore, the investigators propose a physiologic, proof-of-concept study to determine the
      acute effects of b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on energy and fat metabolism in humans. The
      investigators' primary hypothesis is that the administration of BNP will increase energy
      expenditure in humans. The investigators' secondary hypothesis is that BNP administration
      will promote changes in gene expression in adipose tissue suggestive of a ""beige"" fat
      phenotype in humans.

      Research Plan: The investigators propose the following research plan to address the
      investigators' specific aims:

      Primary Aim: To investigate the acute effects of administration of BNP on energy expenditure
      in humans. The investigators propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 50
      adults (25 lean and 25 obese) without significant medical problems. Subjects will be
      randomized to intravenous infusion of recombinant human BNP(1-32) or normal saline (control),
      with assessment of energy expenditure and other physiologic measures. After a 7-day washout
      period, subjects will then undergo the other intervention.

      Secondary Aim: To determine the acute effects of BNP on gene expression in white adipose
      tissue in humans. The investigators will assess markers suggestive of fat beiging in
      subcutaneous white adipose tissue biopsies after BNP infusion vs. control. This secondary aim
      will allow us to explore potential mechanisms underlying the hypothesized changes in energy
      expenditure.

      Methods: In this cross-over study, each subject will receive BNP infusion at one visit and
      control at the other visit, in random order. The sequence of the treatments will be
      randomized. There will be a washout period (at least 14 days) between visits. Subjects will
      be stratified by BMI category (lean or obese). To address the Primary Aim, energy expenditure
      will be assessed via indirect calorimetry (metabolic cart). To address the Secondary Aim,
      subcutaneous fat biopsies will be performed, and tissue will be analyzed for gene expression
      of markers suggestive of fat beiging.

      Clinical Relevance: This study will generate novel human data regarding the effects of the
      NPs on energy metabolism and adipose tissue. Interventions that safely increase energy
      expenditure and promote a beige fat phenotype represent potential strategies for treating
      obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. The overarching scientific goals of this line of
      investigation are (1) to elucidate the role of the natriuretic peptide system in
      cardiometabolic health in humans, and (2) to investigate the potential for NP directed
      therapies in obesity-associated cardiometabolic dysfunction.

      Update about Study Drug Supply Issues: The study started in 7/2018, and the last time
      participants were able to receive study drug was in May 2019, due to discontinuation of study
      drug by the drug manufacturer (nesiritide, Natrecor, Scios, LLC) after May 2019. Another
      potential source of drug supply was being sought out by the study team, and study recruitment
      was placed on hold during the search for new potential sources of study drug. A new viable
      source of study drug has not been identified, and funding is being closed. Thus, this study
      is being terminated. Results will be posted for the 5 participants who were able to complete
      the study procedures prior to the discontinuation of study drug.

      Glutamine is a major fuel for the intestinal tract and immune cells and therefore affects the
      intestinal permeability (IP) and infection rate at critically ill patients. The preferential
      route of glutamine supplementation at critically ill patients still remains open. Therefore
      the researchers will investigate IP, infection rate and treatment outcome at patients
      supplemented with either parenteral or enteral glutamine.

      A prospective randomized single blind study is performed at mechanically ventilated. Patients
      were randomly assigned to either parenteral (group P) or enteral (group E) glutamine
      supplemented group. Early enteral feeding is started in both groups. Patients are/will be
      treated with glutamine for five days. IP will be measured using lactulose/mannitol test (L/M)
      on the fourth day.
    ",Enteral Versus Parenteral Glutamine Supplement,Critically Ill,Critical Illness,"
      The patients who fulfilled the described criteria were randomly assigned to groups P or E
      using sequentially numbered containers for concealed randomization. Those in group P received
      the continuous infusion of parenteral glutamine dipeptide supplement (Dipeptiven 100ml,
      Fresenius Kabi) and were fed enterally with a standard commercial enteral polymeric diet
      without added glutamine (Ensure, Abbott Ross). The patients in group E received the enteral
      glutamine supplement as continuous administration of a standard commercial enteral diet
      supplemented with glutamine (Alitraq, Abbott Ross). The dose of the enteral glutamine, in a
      form of a free acid in this diet, depended on the volume of enteral food. Both groups of
      patients were treated with the glutamine supplement for five days. The other therapeutic
      procedures did not differ between the groups. All the patients were on continuous gastric
      feeding for 20 hours daily, starting with 20ml/hour. The enteral nutrition was started in 24
      hours following admission. The gastric residual was measured three times daily, and when less
      than 250ml, the feeding volume was gradually increased up to 100ml/hour. If needed from day
      two onwards, the patients in all three groups received additional parenteral amino acid and
      glucose solutions to reach the goal 20kcal/kg/day and 0.15g nitrogen/kg/day.

      Intestinal permeability (IP) was measured on day 4 using the lactulose/mannitol (L/M) test.
      For the study purpose, the patients were fasted 6 hours before the test. The test was
      performed with 5g of mannitol (M) and 10g of lactulose (L) mixed in 100ml of water. The
      mixture was given as a bolus via nasogastric tube. At the same time, 4ml of 20% chlorhexidine
      was added into an empty urine bag. The urine was collected in this bag for six hours. Then
      5ml of urine was sampled from the bag and stored at -20˚C until analysis. Two hours after the
      test enteral feeding via nasogastric tube was started. Urinary L and M were determined
      simultaneously with thin-layer chromatography14, a new method in our laboratory for lactulose
      and mannitol determination. The method enabled determination of lactulose and mannitol in
      urine on the same amino HPTLC plate after densitometric quantification of lactulose by use of
      fluorescence mode, and mannitol by use of absorption mode after detection with AgNO3 reagent.
      The new method resulted in shorter analysis time, lower consumption of chemicals and HPTLC
      plates, increased sensitivity (lower limits of detection) and fewer problems with interfering
      compounds at determination of lactulose than the previously used two separate methods for
      determination of both analytes.14 The separation and quantification using this method are
      highly reproducible, yielding standard errors of less than 2.5% for retention times and less
      than 3.5% for quantitation.15,16 The investigators in the laboratory were blinded for the
      study groups. L/M index was calculated from urinary concentrations (c) of L and M using the
      following formula: L/M = c L / (c M x 2). L/M test was not performed at the beginning of the
      study because unstable trauma and septic patients were also included in the study, and at
      these patients, urine collection is difficult to perform.

      Nosocomial infections were recorded during the entire ICU stay as recommended by the Centre
      for Disease Control in Atlanta.17,18 Nosocomial pneumonia was diagnosed when
      Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia Risk Index was 6 or more.19 The infections that were present upon
      admission or diagnosed within the first two days of ICU treatment were marked as acquired
      before ICU admission. All diagnosed infections were treated according to the results of
      microbiological tests and/or according to infection control guidelines. Acute inflammatory
      response was measured with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The blood samples for its
      determination were obtained at baseline and the end of the study.

      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was calculated upon
      admission. Each patient's ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) and six month survival was
      recorded.

      All participants were blinded to interventions. The ICU-staff was not blinded to group
      assignment, but they did not take part in the outcome assessment and on the other hand, the
      outcome assessors and laboratory personnel were blinded to group assignment.

      Septic shock is a condition that is marked by severe infection causing hypotension requiring
      vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs. The Surviving Sepsis campaign,
      an international organization formed for the purpose of guiding the management of sepsis and
      septic shock, currently recommends norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor for septic
      shock. Phenylephrine, a vasopressor FDA-approved for use in septic shock, is recommended as
      an alternative vasopressor when septic shock is complicated by tachyarrhythmia to mitigate
      cardiac complications. This recommendation is based solely on experience with no scientific
      evidence to support this recommendation.

      The investigators will conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) directly
      comparing phenylephrine and norepinephrine, two FDA-approved vasopressors that are both used
      in clinical practice for the management of septic shock. The investigators will perform this
      study with a population of patients that have septic shock to complete the following aims:

      Aim 1: Determine the incidence of tachyarrhythmias.

      Aim 2: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with a
      lower heart rate.

      Aim 3: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with a
      higher incidence of new tachyarrhythmias.

      Aim 4: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with less
      time in tachyarrhythmia.

      Aim 5: Determine which vasopressor, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, is associated with fewer
      complications, including cardiac complications.

      The investigators hypothesize that in this setting, phenylephrine will improve the management
      of septic shock when used as a ""first choice"" vasopressor by:

        1. Decreasing the mean heart rate

        2. Decreasing the incidence of new tachyarrhythmias

        3. Decreasing the amount of time spent in tachyarrhythmia for patients who develop new
           onset and recurrent tachyarrhythmias

      The increased life expectancy of Patients Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has increased the need
      for therapies for chronic conditions, such as chronic pain. Pain in the HIV population is
      often refractory and ends up being treated with chronic opioids, which are associated with
      adverse effects, including hyperalgesia, constipation, and risk of overdose. Naltrexone is an
      opioid antagonist used in the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorders. Low Dose
      Naltrexone (LDN), naltrexone at a much lower dose, is thought to be an immune modulator and
      has been associated with an increased CD4 count in PLWHA. Repurposing this medication is
      relatively inexpensive, and has the potential to expand access to treatment for a painful
      condition experienced in PLWHA. While there are many case reports on the efficacy of LDN in
      symptom reduction, there are only a small number of clinical trials that specifically examine
      pain and symptom relief.

      This study will include patients who are not completely virologically controlled and will
      monitor the CD4 counts drawn as a part of routine care. If the CD4 count improves with LDN
      and with reduced symptoms, this could be a significant improvement in HIV therapy for symptom
      control. There have been studies showing cytokine reduction in fibromyalgia patients but they
      did not investigate the correlation with cytokines and pain relief. This study involves
      repurposing of a drug used for substance use disorder to a medication with the potential to
      treat pain and improve symptoms for PLWHA.

      More than one million people in the United States live with HIV. In 2018, Black/African
      Americans made up 42% of the new HIV diagnoses, while Hispanic persons accounted for 27%.
      Black/African Americans and Hispanics with an HIV diagnosis receive less care for treatment
      and maintenance of HIV than their Caucasian counterparts, and are thus less likely to have
      adequate suppression of the virus. Many people living with HIV/AIDS have untreated chronic
      pain which negatively affects their quality of life. Neuropathic (nerve) pain, including
      painful HIV neuropathy, is notoriously difficult to treat. Opioids (narcotics) are often used
      to treat chronic pain in patients, with inconsistent results. We now know that opioids for
      chronic pain are more consistently known for a multitude of side effects, than effective
      long-term pain relief. Lesser-known side effects of chronic opioids includes suppressing, or
      dampening, the immune system, making opioids particularly undesirable as a chronic therapy
      for pain in the HIV patient population. Other therapies for neuropathic pain have undesirable
      side effects. Naltrexone is FDA approved for addiction and is not used to treat a medical
      disease. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) is an off-label use of naltrexone with some evidence it
      may help chronic pain such as fibromyalgia and some types of neuropathic (nerve) pain. LDN is
      a much lower dose of naltrexone. It has to be compounded to 1/10th the usual dose in order to
      be repurposed to treat pain. In this study, 40 adult patients with HIV will take low-dose
      naltrexone for 12 weeks to treat neuropathic pain. We will measure pain scores and markers of
      inflammation while they are taking LDN. Naltrexone repurposed as LDN has the potential to
      greatly enhance the quality of life of HIV patients. This is particularly meaningful given
      the healthcare disparities often associated with HIV.

      After surgical procedures, interventions to reduce postoperative pain and bleeding are of
      great importance. In this study, the effect will be investigated of smearing common drugs,
      which are designed for injection, directly onto the raw wound surface (topical application)
      created during surgery. Topical application allows a small amount of drug to reach a large

      in the body, and no risk of injury from needles. Although beneficial effects of such an easy
      and low-cost intervention would be expected, the investigators have found no previous reports

      Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is sleep disorder characterized by an unpleasant feeling in the
      lower limbs, which can be accompanied by paresthesias, and need for urgent movement of the
      legs. Its diagnosis is clinical, based on an International Committee of the Study of RLS
      (International Restless Legs Syndrome Study) questionnaire. Its prevalence is about 5-15% in
      the general population, being twice as frequent in women and with a tendency to increase
      incidence with aging. In the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, mainly in patients on
      dialysis, the prevalence increases by up to 70%. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with RLS
      and active vitamin D supplementation seems to improve RLS and severity. It is seems, studies
      on the role of vitamin D supplementation in CKD population are missing. The
      clinical-scientific hypothesis of this study is that replacement of vitamin D
      (cholecalciferol) will improve the symptoms of RLS. As parathyroidectomy can relieve RLS, the

      The aim of this trial is to compare the local anaesthetic ropivacaine to local anaesthetic
      levobupivacaine in converting the standard patient controlled labour epidural to provide
      anaesthesia for an emergency Caesarean section. This is a technique commonly known as an
      epidural top-up. The investigators set out to disprove the hypothesis that there is no
      difference between the 2 local anaesthetics in the time of onset and number of times epidural
      top-up needs supplementing during surgery.
    ",Ropivacaine 0.75% Versus Levobupivacaine 0.5% for Conversion of Labour Epidural,Caesarean Section,,"
      In a randomised controlled trial involving 45 patients the speed of onset of the effects of
      20mls of 0.75% ropivacaine was found to be similar to that of 20mls of 0.5% bupivacaine1.
      However it was also found to be more efficacious at preventing 'breakthrough' pain and
      therefore had a lower intra-operative supplementation rate. Unfortunately the study was
      probably not powered adequately to confirm this finding. Bupivacaine has now largely been
      replaced in the this field by the less cardio-toxic stereoisomer levobupivacaine. A trial
      comparing 0.75% ropivacaine to 0.5% levobupivacaine and a lignocaine/adrenaline/fentanyl
      mixture was conducted in Singapore in 20082. It did not show a clinical difference between
      any of the agents. Whether the population studied is comparable to that in the UK is doubtful
      and it was not adequately powered to detect a difference in intra-operative supplementation
      rate. Local experience has shown ropivacaine 0.75% to provide a block with a rapid onset that
      has little requirement for supplementation intra-operatively. The need to supplement a local
      anaesthetic block during surgery means that the mother is experiencing a degree of pain that
      is unacceptable and we view this as a major consideration in choice of local anaesthetic for
      an epidural top-up. Whilst speed of onset is important, in that it influences the decision to
      delivery time of the baby, the evaluation of intraoperative supplementation will be a major
      focus of this trial.

      Delirium is common in the elderly after orthopedic surgery and is associated with worse

      The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective intraarticular steroid dose for
      the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The investigators aim to randomize patients
      into low, medium, and high dose groups of injectable corticosteroids as these doses are
      typically used in the standard of care for our patients. To date there has been no study to
      evaluate which dose is most efficient with the fewest side effects for glenohumeral
      osteoarthritis. The investigators objective will be to provide ultrasound guided
      intraarticular glenohumeral injections of these randomized concentrations and to evaluate
      pain and function before and following injection with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index
      (SPADI). The investigators hypothesize that the low dose steroid will provide equivalent
      improvement of the pain and function to the medium and high doses, while minimizing side
      effects.
    ",Osteoarthritis Shoulder Injection Study,Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis,"
      Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 54.4 million US adults and 23.7 million (43.5%) have
      arthritis-attributable activity limitation. As the condition progresses, pain and functional
      disability increase. Patients usually begin treatment with conservative measures including
      physical therapy and administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before obtaining
      a corticosteroid injection. Corticosteroid injections have a patient-specific duration that
      often provide relief for a month before the effects begin to taper with most individuals
      returning to baseline by 2-3 months post injection.

      Unfortunately, data on intraarticular injections is not robust and primarily focused on hip,
      knee, and disease processes rather than the glenohumeral joint. For example, steroid
      concentrations have been studied in adhesive capsulitis, where 20 and 40mg of triamcinolone
      acenotide were used with no statistical significance between the two. When a placebo was
      added, both doses were better than the placebo, but once again no difference was seen between
      the two steroid concentrations. Another study, looking at knee osteoarthritis, found that
      high dose steroids had a larger effect on duration, but other studies have shown no
      difference in duration between the 40mg and 80mg concentration of triamcinolone acetonide.

      Intraarticular injections do have adverse effects. Similar to steroids taken orally or
      intravenously, intraarticular injections have a similar side effect profile. Fortunately,
      intraarticular injections are localized, by the nature of the procedure, and the chances of
      experiencing a significant side effect is rare. The most common side effects are steroid
      flare, allergic reaction, facial erythema, hypo-pigmentation, fat pad necrosis, cutaneous
      atrophy, and a transient increase in blood glucose. Some of the rare side effects have been
      seen in case reports include idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy, decrease in breast
      milk production, sepsis, tendon rupture, and cataracts. In addition, the administration of
      steroid injections are limited to being done every three months due to risk of weakening
      tendons, and acceleration of cartilage loss.

      There is a void of literature for understating the ideal injectable steroid concentrations in
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Because of this, providers who perform intraarticular injections
      tend to perform them based on prior training experience or anecdotal evidence. We aim to
      evaluate the ideal steroid concentration that will maximize treatment effect for glenohumeral
      osteoarthritis, but at the same time minimize side effects, and better train our future
      providers.

      Information on the management of casualties from the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and
      Iraq has brought in to question the traditional approach to blood transfusion in hemorrhaging
      patients. Present recommendations for when to transfuse plasma products is when coagulation
      tests become abnormal. The proposed trial will investigate whether the more aggressive plasma
      transfusion strategies as advocated from researchers based on the Central Asian conflicts is
      valid. Since a study to determine the full impact of an altered plasma transfusion practice
      would require thousands of patients, a feasibility trial is appropriate and is being
      proposed. The hypotheses are thus:

      Primary Hypothesis- A multicentre trial that investigates the earlier use of plasma in
      patients with hemorrhagic shock going for emergency surgery will be feasible.

      Secondary Hypotheses- The early use of a universal donor blood plasma (AB+ plasma) in
      patients with shock due to blood loss (i.e. hemorrhagic) going for emergency surgery will
      reduce overall exposure to the total number of blood donor products (so-called allogeneic
      blood exposure). A reduction in allogeneic blood exposure would then reduce the total number
      of blood transfusion-related complications. The early use of this plasma product is safe and
      will not increase the incidence of blood clotting or other transfusion-related complications.
    ",Study Using Plasma for Patients Requiring Emergency Surgery,"['Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Products', 'Trauma', 'Ruptured AAA']","['Hemostatic Disorders', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Emergencies', 'Shock, Hemorrhagic']","
      Investigations that have arisen from reviews of casualty management in the ongoing conflicts
      in Afghanistan and Iraq have challenged the standard approach to blood transfusion in
      hemorrhaging patients. Present recommendations are to ideally transfuse non-red blood cell
      blood products as indicated by coagulation and other blood tests. In the event that testing
      is not available or feasible, then clinical judgment is advised with two recommendations. The
      first is that platelets are usually required after red blood cell (RBC) transfusions of one
      blood volume (approximately 5 liters of blood loss); and the second is that plasma is not
      usually required until RBC transfusion of well over one blood volume. Contrary to these
      recommendations is evidence from these conflicts indicating that delays in plasma transfusion
      or reduced plasma dosing are associated with increased mortality. Although the evidence is
      primarily retrospective and at times circumstantial in nature, the relationship between
      plasma administration and mortality appears to be causation rather than simple association.
      Matching of injury severity and other important variables does not alter this conclusion. If
      this conclusion is true, the question becomes whether or not the transfusion practice of
      patients in a civilian setting should be changed.

      The present plasma transfusion recommendations were largely based on studies of plasma
      exchange patients and the use of data from the 1970's. In plasma exchange, patients have a
      controlled removal of their plasma that is ultimately replaced with donor plasma.
      Coagulopathy develops solely from the amount of plasma removal since no consumption of
      factors exists. Hemorrhaging patients however lose coagulation factors both in shed blood and
      due to ongoing consumption at sites of injury. Further, the hemodynamic instability and
      hypovolemia experienced by hemorrhaging patients further exacerbates the reduction in
      clotting factor levels. Prior to the late 1980's, hemorrhaging patients often received whole
      blood transfusions. Whole blood, no longer used in most circumstances, contains approximately
      1 unit of plasma in each unit. Thus, patients receiving whole blood will not develop a
      coagulopathy as quickly as patients who receive the now standard packed red blood cell units.

      Despite a lack of prospective studies and significant limitations of the supporting evidence,
      the practice of waiting to administer plasma was rapidly adopted. Reasons for this were
      several but included concerns about infectious transmissions, shortage of blood products and
      the financial costs of the blood products. Regardless of the reasons for their development
      however, the present transfusion recommendations including those for plasma may no longer be
      applicable in all circumstances.

      A strong argument against waiting for the coagulopathy to develop before treating is that the
      consequences of the coagulopathy are so grave that they should be avoided. The coagulopathy
      of hemorrhagic shock is a major component of the 'lethal triad' seen in hemorrhaging patients
      (in conjunction with acidosis and hypothermia). The lethal triad has a very high mortality
      rate (over 70%) with limited ability of physicians to treat it. Evidence supporting this
      argument has primarily come from the conflicts in Central Asia. Several retrospective studies
      have been published by the US Army Institute of Surgical Research that have not only
      challenged this practice but have resulted in changes in how the US armed forces manage
      trauma patients. The US military now uses plasma in a 1:1 ratio in their traumatized soldiers
      (i.e. 1 unit of plasma given for every unit of packed RBC).

      Major hemorrhagic injuries in non-military situations consist primarily of traumatic injuries
      and major blood vessel (i.e. vascular) injuries. Although all of these injuries or problems
      are not exactly the same as military casualties, there are major commonalities between these
      population groups that allow the results of the military studies to be applicable to these
      civilian populations. Retrospective and case-control trials in non-military trauma and in
      ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) offer indirect evidence to support a different
      plasma transfusion practice that is more akin to the military recommendations. Computer
      simulations to model massive blood transfusion scenarios also gives credence to the premise
      that traditional transfusion practice is incorrect for actively hemorrhaging patients and
      advocates the earlier use of plasma.

      A retrospective chart review of 5 years of the perioperative management of Priority 1 AAA
      ruptures at The Ottawa Hospital was conducted with research ethics board approval. Of 145
      reviewed cases, there was a 64% survival rate. The use of plasma occurred in over 75% of
      patients and over 99% of patients were exposed to allogeneic blood products. Plasma use was
      associated with poor outcomes and served as a marker for cases with higher blood loss and
      blood product exposure. The use of plasma was however consistent with the present
      recommendations and thus appeared to be reactive in nature, rather than proactive use.

      A definitive trial that assesses the role of early plasma has not been performed.
      Unfortunately, a study to determine the full impact of an altered plasma transfusion practice
      would require thousands of patients. The emergency nature of these surgical patients would
      also make the ability to randomize patients challenging. The goal of the present trial will
      therefore be to assess the feasibility of such a trial. We need to assess the ability to
      randomize patients, to prepare plasma and deliver it in a timely fashion. Further, the
      logistics of having physicians to administer the study fluid (i.e. plasma or colloid control)
      in a timely fashion will be determined. Finally, the ability to accurately measure outcomes
      will be assessed.

      The study will be a prospective evaluation of dapsone gel, 5% in patients with a clinical
      diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. Active disease must occur on the patients' bilateral
      elbows or bilateral knees at the time of study enrollment. Active disease will be defined as
      five or more papules/pustules/vesicles on an extremity. Randomization of one of the patient's
      extremities (either one elbow or one knee) to the treatment group will occur at time of
      enrollment. Randomization will be in the sequence of right side assigned to odd numbered
      patients and left side assigned to even numbered patients. Thus, the first patient to be
      enrolled, patient number one, would be randomized to treatment on his or her right side.
      Depending on the site of active disease, he or she would apply topical dapsone gel, 5% to the
      right elbow or knee twice daily for the duration of the study.

      No blinding of the patients or the PI will occur. The co-investigator will be blinded to
      whether the photographs presented to him at the end of the study are those of a treated or
      untreated extremity.

      The patients will be screened for study enrollment in a private clinic room within the
      dermatology clinic at One Hundred Oaks. Patients will be presented with a study summary sheet
      and a consent form. They will be allowed to ask questions pertaining to the study protocol.
      Information provided to them will be that found in the study protocol alone. If desired,
      informed consent can be taken home with the patient to consider, and enrollment can be
      performed at a later date. In that instance, the patient would be brought back for an
      additional visit at the time of consent and study enrollment. Study enrollment and first
      treatment will be performed on the day of study consent. Digital photographs of each elbow or
      each knee (treatment and control) will be taken on the day of enrollment to serve as a
      baseline evaluation. The number of lesions (including papules, plaques and vesicles) will be
      recorded for the treatment and control elbow or knee. Measurements of each lesion will be
      taken and recorded as well. This data will be written in a chart and stored in the PI's
      notebook in a locked cabinet in the department of dermatology. Digital photographs will be
      printed out on the same day as the visit and placed in the notebook as well. Two copies of
      each photograph will be made. Each photograph will be assigned a letter, A through Z, based
      on a code for each patient. One copy of each set of photographs will also include the date.
      No patient identifiable features will be included in the photograph such as the face or eyes.
      Each photograph will be of the treated or control area only. The code to identify patient
      photographs will be assigned by the Data and Safety Monitor and kept in a separate locked
      cabinet. The code will be broken following the blinded evaluation of the photographs by
      co-investigator.

      The patient will be given oral instructions regarding the application of topical dapsone gel,
      5% by the PI on the day of enrollment. The PI will apply the first treatment to the
      randomized extremity during the first clinic visit. The patient will then remain in the
      treatment room for fifteen minutes to evaluate for any immediate adverse reaction. The PI
      will remain in the room with the patient. At the end of the fifteen minute evaluation, the
      patient will be sent home with written instructions for application and a 30gm tube of
      ACZONE™ (dapsone) Gel, 5%. Patients will apply the study drug to the indicated elbow or knee
      each morning and evening for the two weeks. They will return to the dermatology clinic in two
      weeks and be seen in a private clinic room by the PI for a follow up visit. At that time,
      photographs, lesion counts and measurements will be taken again, just as they were at the
      initial visit. The patient will be asked to report any adverse events at that time. Patients
      will be instructed to continue treatment and follow up in two weeks. The same parameters will
      be evaluated at the four week visit and again at the six week visit, which will be the
      completion of the study.

      Patients will discontinue treatment after six weeks. The co-investigator will be presented
      will all photograph marked with the patient letter only. He will not know the sequence of the
      photographs or dates taken. He will then assign a number according to his subjective
      evaluation of the clinical photographs, while also being blinded to which elbow or knee was
      treated, right or left. The scores assigned will follow the criteria listed in the
      investigator's Dermatitis Herpetiformis Assessment Score. The code to the photographs will be
      broken after the completion of photograph evaluation. Photographs of a set will be matched to
      those with both letter and date to determine the scores in chronological order.

      Six weeks after completion of treatment each patient will be contacted by phone and asked a
      series of five questions. That will conclude the study.

      Depressive symptoms, in patients with a life history of major depressive disorder (MDD), are
      very common in the general population, and are especially so in elderly adults undergoing
      surgery.Symptoms of depression at the time of surgery is associated with risk for
      postoperative complications.Attenuating depressive symptoms in patients undergoing surgery is
      thus a plausible but not adequately tested strategy for improving patient postoperative
      outcomes. Conventional treatment of depression takes weeks and, therefore, is not always a
      realistic option, particularly when surgery is urgent. Importantly, there are currently no
      guidelines for diagnosing and managing MDD in surgical patients. Given its association with
      complications including perioperative cognitive disorders such as delirium, and over longer
      periods of time with dementing disorders, the feasibility and efficacy of quick-acting
      treatments for depressive symptoms in surgical patients are direly needed. This need is
      particularly acute given the rising number of elderly patients undergoing surgery who are
      prone to depression and surgical complications.

      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients in a clinical trial where a
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) is given 1
      to 3 days before surgery in the preoperative clinic as a strategy to improve depressive
      symptoms during the perioperative period.

      Aim 2: To obtain estimates of the variability in improvements of depressive symptoms
      (increase from baseline in MADRS score ≥ 2)1 day after surgery for patients given a
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) 1 to 3 days before surgery compared

      clinic (as an outpatient) by assessment of dysphoric symptoms or other complications

      Aim 2: Hypothesis: Compared with midazolam, a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine given
      preoperatively leads to an improvement in MADRS score ≥ 2 on day 1 after surgery.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether QL blocks reduce opioid consumption following
      arthroscopic hip surgery by decreasing postoperative pain. Considering the current opioid
      epidemic, the responsibility of physicians to help prevent addiction, and the increasing
      prevalence of arthroscopic hip surgeries, this study holds a tremendous potential benefit for
      future patients.
    ",The Role of Nerve Blocks in Hip Arthroscopy,Femoroacetabular Impingement,Femoracetabular Impingement,"
      The popularity of arthroscopic hip surgery has increased greatly over the last 10 years,
      particularly for correcting Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI). FAI is a structural
      abnormality of the proximal femur, the acetabulum, or both. It is a leading cause of labral
      tears in the hip joint and can cause cartilage damage, which may increase subsequent risk of
      developing osteoarthritis. Though far less invasive than open hip surgery such as for a total
      hip replacement, hip arthroscopy can cause significant postoperative pain for the patient.
      Given how relatively new the procedure still is, methods of pain control are highly variable.
      Peripheral nerve blocks, mainly femoral nerve and lumbar plexus blocks, have been used by
      some surgeons to control postoperative pain. However, in addition to their sensory effects,
      these blocks cause motor impairment that has been associated with a significantly higher risk
      of falling.

      In managing pain after any operation, opioid consumption is, of course, a significant
      concern. Ideally, hip arthroscopy patients could receive a peripheral nerve block that
      decreases pain and the need for opioids, but without the muscular weakness and increased fall
      risk observed with femoral nerve and lumbar plexus blocks. This may be achievable with the
      newer Quadratus Lumborum (QL) block.

      The ultrasound-guided QL block is currently most commonly used for abdominal surgery.

      However, several case studies of a single-injection QL block in hip replacement surgeries
      have been successful in minimizing pain and opioid use while sparing motor function and
      avoiding the muscle weakness that can lead to falls. In the approach utilized in these cases,
      local anesthetic was injected at the anterolateral border of the QL muscle to achieve
      analgesia ranging from the T6-T10 through L3 dermatomes. One group has anecdotally reported
      great success in using these QL blocks for alleviating postoperative pain with hip
      arthroscopy, but no studies to date have evaluated the effectiveness of QL blocks for
      arthroscopic hip surgery.

      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. Patients undergoing hip
      arthroscopy who agree to participate will be randomly selected to receive an
      ultrasound-guided QL block with either local anesthetic (QL block group) or normal saline
      (control group) preoperatively.

      After surgery and during the first postoperative week, patients will record their numerical
      pain score, the location of their pain, and their opioid consumption using our attached study
      instrument. On this form, they will record their pain score at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24,
      and 48 hours and 7 days after surgery. The form specifies that if patients are unable to
      record their pain score at any of these time points, particularly because they are
      sleeping/recovering, they can simply skip that time point. For pain location, patients are
      instructed to draw X's on a standard cartoon at the site of their pain. For opioid
      consumption, patients simply record when and how many pills they take. This form will be
      collected from patients at their 10-14 day postoperative visit. Data will also be collected
      from the medical chart on time to discharge and any complications in the perioperative
      period. Questionnaires will be used to assess pain, physical and social health, such as
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).

      This research is being done so that we can look at the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in

      Deferiprone (brand name Ferriprox®) is an iron chelator that is approved in the United States
      and over 60 other countries for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia,
      when other treatments are inadequate. This study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of deferiprone vs. deferoxamine in patients who have SCD or other
      anemias, and who require chelation because of the extra iron they are taking in through blood
      transfusions.

      About 300 people from North America, South America, Europe, and the Middle East will take
      part in this study. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapy for 52
      weeks with either deferiprone or deferoxamine, another type of iron chelator. Patients who
      are randomized to the deferiprone group can choose to get the drug as either tablets or
      liquid, and must take it three times daily. Patients who are randomized to the deferoxamine
      group will receive it as a subcutaneous infusion that lasts from 8 to 12 hours and is given 5
      to 7 days per week. For both drugs, the starting dosage is based on how much extra iron they
      have taken in through transfusions in the last 3 months and on the severity of iron load, as
      measured by serum ferritin levels in the blood and by the amount of iron in the liver and the
      heart. For deferiprone, the starting dosage will be increased each week over the first 3
      weeks; and for both drugs, the dosage may be adjusted up or down during the study based on
      the level of iron overload and on safety considerations.

      Patients will need to have their blood count checked every week for the first 26 weeks, then
      every other week for the remaining 26 weeks; they will also have to give a blood sample for
      more detailed safety testing every month; and to give a blood sample for the measurement of
      serum ferritin every 3 months. Every six months, they will undergo an ECG and an MRI scan,
      and will be asked to complete a quality of life survey.

      At the end of the 52 weeks, participants will be invited to enter a 2-year study in which all

      This study compares two blood thinners which are both accepted standard cares, fondaparinux
      and unfractionated heparin (UFH). These drugs are used to prevent the growth of existing
      blood clots and formation of additional blood clots in patients with pulmonary embolism (a
      blood clot in the lung) as they are beginning to take warfarin (another standard care blood
      thinner). Patients will be invited to participate because they have been diagnosed with a
      pulmonary embolism, require anticoagulation therapy (treatment with a blood thinner), and are
      currently hospitalized.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients treated with fondaparinux will have
      shorter hospital stays and lower costs of treatment while in the hospital than similar
      patients receiving a different standard care with UFH. Fondaparinux is already approved by
      the FDA for use in patients with pulmonary embolism, for both inpatient and outpatient care,
      as long as treatment is begun with warfarin while they are hospitalized. It is therefore not
      an experimental treatment. The study is being conducted to determine which FDA approved
      treatment is the best practice for hospital treatment of pulmonary embolism. The study will
      also examine the safety and effectiveness of fondaparinux in local use.

           before emergence according to primary team judgment.

        -  Ketorolac 30 mg IV at skin closure unless otherwise contraindicated.

      The aim of this study is to describe changes at the site of the study patient's articular
      cartilage lesion on the femoral condyle with multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      outcomes 6 months after treatment using one of three standard surgical treatment methods: 1)
      lavage debridement; 2) mechanical debridement; 3) mechanical and radiofrequency-based
      debridement.
    ",Knee Articular Cartilage Debridement in Conjunction With Partial Meniscectomy,Torn Meniscus,,"
      Fibrillated articular cartilage are commonly detected during arthroscopy when treating knee
      pathologies such as a torn meniscus or a damaged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The
      severity of these lesions is graded using a scheme such as the International Cartilage
      Research Society (ICRS) classification system. Grade I lesions are often left untreated,
      while Grade IV lesions require dedicated surgical intervention. Grade II and III lesions are
      frequently treated when they are encountered arthroscopically.

      Currently, it is not known whether treatment of fibrillated articular cartilage is beneficial
      or whether one procedure is superior to another. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best
      technique currently available for non-invasive assessment of chondral lesions. The primary
      aim of the proposed study is to compare post-procedure MR imaging characteristics of
      fibrillated articular cartilage treated using one of the three standard of care measures: 1)
      Washing of the knee joint with saline solution to clear blood, fluid or loose tissue (also
      known as lavage); 2) Lavage in addition to mechanical shaver (a manual surgical tool used by
      the study doctor); and 3)Lavage in addition to the Paragon device (RF-based
      microdebridement), which may also be used with a mechanical (or manual) surgical tool. The
      secondary aim is to determine the association between imaging features and clinical outcomes.

      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine the influence of chlorhexidine gluconate
      surgical/topical antiseptic solutions on the bacterial environment of the vagina during
      hysterectomy and compare that to the effect of standard iodine-based preparations on the
      same.
    ",Vaginal Preparation Prior to Hysterectomy,Hysterectomy,,"
      Postoperative infection remains the most common complication of surgical procedures in
      gynecology. Historically, 30-40% of patients undergoing a hysterectomy develop a
      post-operative infection. The initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis for appropriate surgical
      procedures was a significant advancement in the prevention of surgical site infection.

      Antibiotic prophylaxis has been standardized and universally implemented. A remaining
      variable is the method of aseptic preparation of the vagina with substantial variation of
      technique being reported even within institutions.

      The most recent Committee Opinion by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      concludes there is insufficient evidence to render a strong recommendation for either
      povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine as the ideal agent for surgical preparation of the vagina
      and that further evidence is necessary.

      Povidone-iodine solution has been considered the standard for aseptic surgical preparation of
      the vagina for decades and is the only solution approved by the FDA for vaginal use. There
      are however specific qualities of the solution that suggest it may be less than ideal for use
      in the vagina. More contemporary efforts have begun to focus on chlorhexidine as a more ideal
      agent for aseptic efforts in surgical preparation of the vagina.

      The purpose of our study is to use a randomized controlled trial to determine if
      chlorhexidine gluconate surgical preparation maintains a lower rate of contamination to the

      either treatment arm and followed for 12 weeks. Patients who have wound closure within the
      12-week study period will continue to have wound care visits as scheduled. All subjects will
      have Wound Evaluation Visits and Wound Dressing Change Visits. Wound Evaluation Visits will
      occur at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after the date of randomization, where following
      removal of the dressing, a detailed wound assessment (e.g., wound characteristics,
      measurements) will be done and healthcare resource utilization will be collected. Disease
      specific quality of life measures and preference based quality of life measures (EQ-5D) will
      be collected at baseline, 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. Dressing Change Visits will occur as
      clinically required and the frequency of dressing changes per week will be allowed to vary
      over the 12 weeks of the study. During the dressing change visits, subjects will be monitored

      Purpose/Objectives: Severe sepsis and septic shock are a common cause of new onset atrial
      fibrillation (NOAF) in the intensive care unit. Development of NOAF in this setting can
      prolong length of stay and increase mortality. Amiodarone is the most commonly used agent
      used in this setting to control rate and rhythm. However, limited data exist detailing
      appropriate dosing in this setting. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate two
      amiodarone dosing strategies, a full loading dose versus a partial loading dose, in patients
      with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) due to severe sepsis or septic shock to assess the
      mean heart rate every 6 hours after initiation of amiodarone infusion to day 7 or death.

      Research Design/Plan: Consecutive patients admitted to the medical or cardiac intensive care
      unit at University Hospital with NOAF in the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock will be
      screened for study inclusion. Data will be collected and stored using Microsoft Excel or
      Access and analyzed with JMP 12.0 and SPSS.

      Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older who develop new-onset atrial fibrillation in the
      setting of severe sepsis or septic shock and in whom the medical team deems appropriate to
      initiate amiodarone therapy in will be considered for study inclusion. Patients will receive
      intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) amiodarone, as per the standard of care. Patients will be
      randomized to a certain quantitative loading dose strategy; either a full loading dose (≥ 5g
      IV or ≥10g PO +/- 20%) or a partial loading dose (<4g IV or < 8g PO).

      Clinical Relevance: With intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) and mortality being
      twice as high in NOAF with sepsis as compared to septic patients without NOAF, the
      investigators ultimately aim to identify a management strategy that may minimize this
      morbidity and mortality while also minimizing exposure to a drug that may cause serious
      adverse effects.

      and those who are pregnant.

      Intervention: Patients aged 18 years or older who develop new-onset atrial fibrillation in
      the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock and in whom the medical team deems appropriate
      to initiate amiodarone therapy in will be considered for study inclusion. All patients will
      receive a 150 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone, followed immediately by a continuous infusion
      of 1 mg/min for the first six hours, with a recommended reduction to 0.5 mg/min subsequently.
      Conversion from IV to PO amiodarone will occur based on patient hemodynamic stability and
      physician/pharmacist discretion. Patients will be randomized to receive amiodarone at a full
      loading dose (≥ 5g IV or ≥10g PO +/- 20%) or a partial loading dose (<4g IV or < 8g PO). The
      assigned total loading dose will include all IV and PO amiodarone administered within 7 days
      from initiation of amiodarone. All doses will be compared in total PO amount (accounting for
      50% bioavailability of PO versus IV amiodarone). The primary attending or fellow physician
      may over-ride randomization if the patient's amiodarone dose if the patient's severity of
      illness warrants a duration that differs from that assigned during randomization. In the full
      loading dose group, discontinuation of amiodarone will be at the discretion of the
      physician/pharmacists, after the pre-determined randomization loading dose has been provided.

      Management Components: Facilities to be used throughout the project include the University
      Hospital and The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Equipment use for
      direct patient care will be in keeping with standards-of-care, without any additional
      equipment being required for the clinical research study.

      Data Collection: Data collection will include age, race, gender, body mass index (BMI), data
      for calculating an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and Sequential
      Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, suspected source of infection, identified pathogens,
      pre-existing conditions that may predispose the patient to AF and the severity/classification
      of such illness (coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus); vital signs at the onset of AF (mean
      arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate), lactate, pH (scale of acidity), and
      serum bicarbonate at the time of AF onset; fluid resuscitation volume for the 24 hours prior
      to AF, vasopressor use (including drug, dose, duration) in the preceding 24 hours; other
      medications used to stabilize hemodynamic status in AF (e.g. β-blockers, calcium channel
      blockers, digoxin), other attempted methods of cardioversion attempted prior to amiodarone
      use (e.g. direct current cardioversion, other antiarrhythmic drug therapy); amiodarone
      loading dose, cumulative study amiodarone dose; the duration of time spent in AF before
      conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), the incidence of AF recurrence; and hemodynamic
      variables to be assessed at various time points after the initiation of amiodarone (-6 hours,
      at onset of AF, 2 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and every 6 hours thereafter until day 7 or
      death) including mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, systolic blood pressure,
      heart rate, pH, serum bicarbonate, and serum lactate.

      Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety:

      Efficacy: Patients will be stratified based on response to therapy into one of three groups:
      conversion to NSR, non-converting AF that is hemodynamically stable or non-converting AF that
      is hemodynamically unstable. The primary efficacy outcome is the mean heart rate every 6
      hours after initiation of the amiodarone infusion to day 7 or death. Secondary efficacy
      endpoints will include the percentage of time spent hemodynamically unstable in the first 7
      days following amiodarone initiation, ICU LOS, hospital LOS and 28-day mortality along with
      comparisons of the individual portions of the hemodynamic endpoints [mean arterial pressure
      (MAP), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure(SBP)], cumulative vasopressor doses of
      norepinephrine and vasopressin, central venous pressure (CPR), conversion to NSR, maintenance
      of NSR, proportion of time spent in NSR after the start of the infusion to day 7 or death,
      pH, standard bicarbonate, serum lactate, and central venous oxygen saturation.

      Safety: Safety outcomes include worsening of hypotension (largely related to the rate of
      infusion and the polysorbate 80 diluent), bradycardia, acute elevations of liver function
      tests ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal, phlebitis, QTc prolongation, skin reactions,
      neuropathy, and pulmonary toxicity. We will also collect premature study discontinuation due
      to any adverse event. Because the experimental group of this study is a partial load of
      amiodarone, rather than a full load, it is likely that the experimental group will experience
      fewer amiodarone related adverse effects than those receiving the current practice. In the
      setting of worsening hemodynamic stability during amiodarone infusion (i.e. SBP <90 mmHg OR
      MAP < 70 mmHg, despite HR control of < 120 bpm; need for fluid boluses ± vasopressors or
      dobutamine), which the medical team believes to be caused by IV amiodarone therapy:

        1. the amiodarone infusion rate should be decreased by 50%, with efforts to increase back
           to the standard infusion rate after the patient is hemodynamically stable, or

        2. switch from IV amiodarone to PO amiodarone therapy at a dose of 400 mg PO three times
           daily (TID), or

        3. emergent electro-cardioversion at the discretion of the medical team (as is the standard
           of care)

      Data Analysis Plan: Data will be collected and stored using Microsoft Excel or Access. After
      data organization and cleaning, data will be imported into JMP 12.0 or SPSS. Data will be
      analyzed using both descriptive and comparative statistics. The primary outcome will be
      analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Nominal and ordinal variables will be compared using
      Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables will be tested
      for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk W goodness of fit test. Continuous variables with normal
      distributions will be compared using the student's t-test, while non-parametric variables
      will be compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical significance will be defined
      as an alpha level less than 0.05.

      All baseline demographics, including patient comorbidities, amount of fluid resuscitation,
      previous vasoactive therapies, and use of other interventions such as direct current
      cardioversion, will be entered into a multivariate regression model if the p value is less
      than 0.20 on univariate comparison between treatment groups. The multivariate regression
      model will be used to assess if baseline factors or previous treatment other than the
      intervention affected the study outcomes.

      Based on extrapolation from available literature assessing HR control at 24 hours, we
      estimate that the full loading dose group will have a mean HR of 110 bpm over the course of 7
      days, while the partial loading dose group will have a mean HR of 130 bpm over the course of
      7 days. 7 day mean HR that is 20 bpm lower than the partial loading dose group. Therefore, we
      estimate that 250 patients will be necessary in each group to have an 85% power to detect a
      difference, assuming a 15% drop-out rate.

      Hundreds of thousands of couples in the United States experience infertility each year. When
      initial measures do not help, some couples require a process called ovarian stimulation and
      in vitro fertilization (IVF). Usually, a woman produces at most one egg each month. Ovarian
      stimulation helps these women make more than one egg per month. However, this involves taking
      hormones that stimulate the ovary to produce many eggs at one time. The stimulatory hormones
      injected with a small needle. The eggs are removed from the ovary through a surgical
      procedure and then placed in a dish for fertilization by sperm to form embryos. The embryos
      are grown in the laboratory then replaced into the woman's uterus 3-5 days later.

      The stimulation of the ovaries is important. Some patients undergo ovarian stimulation for
      IVF but do not respond to the treatment. This is a very difficult situation because even
      though several ovarian stimulation protocols have been used for poor responder patients, it
      is not clear which protocol works best. In fact, two of the most commonly used protocols have
      not been directly compared.

      This study will randomize (like flipping a coin) couples with a history of low response who
      are going to start IVF treatment into two groups. In one group the female partner will use a
      protocol called ""E2 patch/antagonist"". These women will use an estrogen patch and injected
      antagonist for several days before starting injectable fertility medications. The other group
      will use a protocol called ""OCP/microdose"". This group of women will use oral contraceptive
      pills (OCPs) and small doses of lupron along with the other injectable fertility medications.
      We will then follow their progress to see how many eggs they produce and how many women get
      pregnant.
    ",Oral Microdose Lupron Versus Luteal Estradiol Trial in Poor Responder In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Patients,Infertility,Infertility,"
      Patients who have difficulty conceiving naturally often seek medical advice. These patients
      often undergo initial treatment with insemination using oral or injectable medications.
      However, if this fails to achieve a pregnancy, patients often undergo in vitro fertilization
      (IVF). IVF is a process which involves a protocol of injectable medications to stimulate the
      ovary to produce several eggs at once. These eggs are retrieved under ultrasound guidance and
      fertilized in the laboratory. After 3-5 days of growth in the laboratory, the appropriate
      number of embryos is then transferred back to the patient's uterus.

      Sometimes, patients who go through ovarian stimulation and IVF do not respond well. These
      patients have low estrogen levels, few eggs retrieved, and fewer embryos to transfer back to
      the uterus. Overall, they have lower pregnancy rates than other patients. It is not clear
      which medication protocol would give them the highest chance of pregnancy. Two protocols, one
      called the ""E2/antagonist"" protocol and the other called the ""OCP/microdose"" protocol, are
      routinely used in poor responder patients. But, they have never been prospectively compared
      so it is not possible to say whether one approach is better.

      In order to determine which medication protocol results in more pregnancies, we propose to
      randomize poor responder patients who are scheduled to undergo treatment with IVF to one of
      these two protocols. These two protocols are already standard care in IVF centers around the
      world. Following randomization, the clinical care of study participants will be the same as
      all other IVF patients. Specifically, the adjustment of medication, egg retrieval, and embryo
      transfer procedures will be identical to non-study patients undergoing IVF.

      HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize that the poor responder patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for
      IVF with the E2/antagonist protocol will have a higher pregnancy rate than those in the
      OCP/microdose group.

      Anti-anginal drugs relieve ischemia and symptoms by reducing myocardial oxygen demand by
      reducing heart rate and or contractility (beta-blockers, phenylalkylamine and
      benzothiazepineate classes of calcium antagonists) or vasodilatation of the venous system
      (fall in pre-load) and coronary vessels.

      Late sodium channels remain open for longer in the presence of myocardial ischaemia.
      Ranolazine, a novel anti-anginal agent, acts by inhibiting the inward late inward sodium
      current (INaL), reducing intracellular sodium accumulation and consequently intracellular
      calcium overload via the sodium/calcium exchanger. It is currently thought that this
      reduction in intracellular calcium reduces diastolic myocardial stiffness and therefore
      compression of the small coronary vessels. There is considerable animal data to support this
      theory.

      There are good theoretical reasons to postulate that patients with chronically occluded
      vessels may derive less benefit from conventional anti-anginal agents, particularly
      vasodilators. The ischemic myocardium, subtended by the occluded vessel, will already be
      subject to significant concentrations of paracrine vasodilators such as adenosine.
      Ranolazine, therefore, may on the basis of its mechanism of action, provide greater relief of
      ischemia in such patients than conventional anti-anginal agents.

      To test this hypothesis, a randomized study comparing addition of ranolazine to addition of a
      minimum of 2 conventional anti-anginal agents in patients with chronic total occlusions would
      be required. To be sufficiently powered, this would require a significant number of patients

      The investigators plan to conduct a two arm study, to compare failure rates in the central
      nervous system (CNS) and genital compartment in virologically fully suppressed patients
      continuing a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) versus patients switching to
      ritonavir boosted lopinavir (Kaletra®) HIV-monotherapy. The study is composed of two phases
      of 48 weeks duration.

      In addition, neuropsychological tests (Color trial test A 1 and 2; Grooved pegboard; EWIA
      Digit Symbol form) and evaluation of side effects will be performed.
    ",HIV - Monotherapy in Switzerland (MOST-ch),HIV Infections,HIV Infections,"
      In the first phase (phase A), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (Kaletra®) will be compared with
      continued HAART. In the second year (phase B) patients on conventional HAART are also offered
      LPV/r monotherapy to extend the longterm experience of this new strategy.

      Only patients willing to give a genital secretion and a spinal fluid sample will be included.
      All patients must be on a fully suppressive HAART with at least 2 consecutive values of
      HIV-RNA at the screening visit . After performance of lumbar puncture at baseline, patients
      will be randomized to continued HAART or LPV/r monotherapy. During the first year of
      randomized treatment patients will be followed at week 6/ 12 /18 /24 /32 /40 and 48. Lumbar
      puncture and genital secretion sampling will be repeated at week 48.

      Follow up during the second phase (B: W48-96) of the study will be identical to phase A
      including genital and spinal sampling at week 96. After study termination at week 96,
      patients may opt to continue monotherapy if results of HIV-RNA in blood and CSF support this
      decision.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be treatment failure in the compartment (CSF and / or
      genital tract). Since the variability of HIV-RNA determination in CSF and genital secretions
      is not very well known, a one log increase above the baseline value will be considered as
      treatment failure in the respective compartment. Only patients who had a complete viral
      suppression in blood will be considered for compartment evaluation. Patients treated in the
      monotherapy arm with a CSF HIV-RNA value at week 48 more than 1.0 log10 cp/ml above baseline
      (= compartment failure) will be switched to a conventional combination treatment. HIV-RNA
      testing in the genital samples will be performed batchwise at the end of the study.

      In addition, patients with a blood treatment failure (two consecutive HIV-RNA detections >
      400cp/ml) will be considered as full treatment failures and switched to a rescue regimen at
      the discretion of the treating physician. For the analysis, these patients will be considered
      as systemic treatment failure and will not be entered in the analysis of compartmentalized
      treatment failure. If the rescue strategy was only intensification of adherence and results
      in full blood viral load re-suppression, the patient will still be maintained in the study
      and compartment evaluations can be performed at w48 and/or 96, respectively.

      The secondary aim of the study is the definition of prognostic markers for compartment
      failures. Potential risk factors associated with mono-maintenance failure are HIV-DNA load at
      time of treatment simplification, HIV-RNA at the time of first treatment initiation, duration
      of HIV-RNA suppression before simplification, history of HIV-RNA blips, presence of
      detectable HIV-RNA in spinal fluid at the time of treatment simplification, changes of level
      of c-reactive protein (high sensitive methodology, hsCRP) from baseline as a marker of
      immune-activation during the maintenance therapy.

      If funding allows, we will test for the presence of resistant viruses and compare the
      presence of genetic polymorphism at baseline. We will also measure parameters of
      immunoactivation (hsCRP, CD8+, CD38+).

      visits.

      Statistical Methods:

      Summary statistics will be provided for safety and efficacy parameters as well as for the
      patients' demographic characteristics. Data will be presented per visit, if appropriate. The
      test for the primary endpoint is confirmative. Statistical tests of secondary endpoints will
      be employed for exploratory purposes to highlight interesting comparisons (e.g., baseline
      versus end of study) that may warrant further consideration. Unless otherwise specified, the
      significance level of all statistical tests will be 5% with a two-sided alternative. If
      appropriate, corresponding 95%-confidence intervals will be calculated. The sample size
      estimation is based on t-test calculation.

      Continuous variables will be summarized as mean +/- SD and median with range where
      appropriate. Continuous variables will be compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
      pairwise Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni-correction. Nominal variables will be compared
      using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Changes within groups of
      nominal variables will be analyzed using McNemar test.

      Changes within groups of continuous variables will be analyzed using the Friedman test
      followed by pairwise post hoc comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni
      correction. Prevalence of anaemia will be presented with exact confidence interval (CI).
      Continuous variables will be transformed to normal distribution, and CIs for the mean will be
      computed. The limits of these CIs then will be retransformed to the original units and
      interpreted as CIs for the median.

      Cardiac function may improve in patients with end-stage heart failure who receive long-term
      support with ventricular assist devices (VAD). Reverse left ventricular remodeling may be
      sufficient in some cases to allow explantation of the VAD. However, some questions continue
      to await definitive answers. This study is designed to assess the myocardial recovery under
      VAD support with optimal pharmacological therapy (high doses [group I] of statins,
      beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus standard doses [group II]).

      The study is a randomized, single-blind trial performed at the Department of Cardiac Surgery,
      University of Strasbourg, France. Twenty patients with end-stage heart failure who will be
      supported by VAD (Thoratec paracorporeal device) as a bridge to heart transplantation will be
      included. Reverse left ventricular remodeling and myocardial function will be studied by:
      echocardiography, respiratory mitochondrial function, exercise testing, cardiac hormonal
      function, and inflammatory response. Myocardial biopsies will be obtained at the time of VAD
      implantation and heart transplantation. The follow-up will be performed every 4 weeks during
      the VAD support period. The hypothesis of this trial is that reverse left ventricular
      remodeling and myocardial function will improve under optimal medical therapy especially by a
      high dose statin.

      Ferumoxytol injection (Feraheme®) is a parenteral form of iron supplementation that is
      FDA-approved for treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Ferumoxytol injection achieves iron
      repletion in fewer doses (2) when compared with other available injectable iron formulations
      (5-6) available at NYU Langone Health, and thus may be useful to reduce travel burden and
      expedite full iron repletion in patients with iron deficiency. Iron-deficiency anemia is
      common in patients after placement of a ventricular assist device (VAD) for treatment of
      end-stage heart disease. This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of iron repletion with

      Eclampsia is an obstetric emergency capable of prophylaxis. To prevent and control seizures,
      there is no doubt that the magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the ideal drug. However, there are
      still questions regarding its use and dose. The scheme and the optimal time of administration
      remain to be elucidated. The objective of this trial is to compare the effectiveness and
      safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate in the maintenance phase 1g / h versus 2 g / h to
      prevent eclampsia in pregnant and postpartum women with severe preeclampsia (pure or

    ",Different Schemes of Magnesium Sulfate for Preeclampsia,Preeclampsia,Pre-Eclampsia,"
      Hypertensive disorders are frequent during the course of pregnancy-puerperal cycle and an
      important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, fetal and perinatal. The high frequency
      of maternal death can be explained by the presence of numerous complications such as
      eclampsia. Eclampsia is an obstetric emergency capable of prophylaxis. To prevent and control
      seizures, there is no doubt that the magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the ideal drug. However,
      there are still questions regarding its use and dose. The scheme and the optimal time of
      administration remain to be elucidated. Currently, allows the use of either 1 g / h to 2 g /
      h of magnesium sulphate during the maintenance phase to prevent eclamptic convulsions.
      However, there is no report in the literature of randomized controlled trials comparing
      different doses of magnesium sulfate in the maintenance phase to prevent eclampsia.

      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of intravenous
      magnesium sulfate in the maintenance phase 1g / h versus 2 g / h to prevent eclampsia in
      pregnant and postpartum women with severe preeclampsia (pure or superimposed).There will be a
      trial randomized and triple blind in the Integrative Medicine Institute Prof. Fernando
      Figueira (IMIP) from March 2015 to April 2017, and will be included 2000 women randomized
      into two groups: MgSO4 maintenance dose of 1 g / h or 2 g / h. Patients who had eclampsia
      before loading dose, with use of other medications or illicit drugs that may interfere with
      maternal hemodynamics or with contraindications to the use of magnesium sulfate will be
      excluded. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of eclampsia. Other complications such
      as oliguria, bleeding, recurrence of seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation,
      maternal death, presence of side effects related to the use of MgSO, neonatal outcome and
      other variables will be considered secondary outcomes. Randomization for preventive treatment

      Adenomyosis affects approximately 21% of symptomatic women who present to gynecology clinics.
      The disease is characterized by heavy bleeding and pain during periods. Limited treatment
      options exist for the treatment of adenomyosis for women who desire future child-bearing or
      prefer to avoid surgery. Recently, ulipristal acetate has been studied as a treatment option
      for women who have fibroids and heavy bleeding. The majority of women treated with ulipristal
      stopped having periods altogether. Our study aims to determine whether ulipristal is an
      adequate treatment for women with adenomyosis.

      Adenomyosis affects an estimated 20.9% of symptomatic women who present to gynecology
      clinics, with peak prevalence of 32% in 40-49 years old. Prior histologic studies in women
      undergoing hysterectomy show prevalence of with some variation due to differing histologic
      diagnostic criteria 10-37.1%. Heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea are commonly
      manifested in women with adenomyosis. However, data on treatment of adenomyosis remains
      scarce. For women desiring definitive options, hysterectomy remains the treatment of choice.
      However, for women who desire future fertility, the currently accepted first-line therapy is
      progestogen therapy, particularly the levonorgestrel-IUD. Other limited studies have used
      danazol and GnRH agonists, but its use is limited by significant side effects.

      Recently, the selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM) have emerged as successful
      medical treatment options for leiomyoma. The SPRM ulipristal acetate has been studied
      extensively in the treatment of leiomyoma and more recently endometriosis. Ulipristal acetate
      exerts both antagonist and agonist properties. Amenorrhea was achieved in 80% of women taking
      5mg of ulipristal daily by treatment month 2 and up to 90% of women taking 10mg daily.
      Anovulation was achieved in 80% of women taking 5mg and 10mg dosing. Ulipristal acetate has
      not been studied as a treatment option for women with adenomyosis. We aim to study the effect
      of daily ulipristal on heavy menstrual bleeding in women with adenomyosis.

      We propose to test whether intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine will reduce
      hemodynamic control in the intra- and post-operative periods and reduces PACU analgesic
      requirements in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
    ",The Effects of Dexmedetomidine and Remifentanil on Carotid Patients,Carotid Artery Stenosis,Carotid Stenosis,"
      Remifentanil is an amidopiperidine derivative with unique pharmacokinetic properties. Its
      steady-state volume of distribution is 30 L (3). Its context-sensitive half life is
      consistently short (3.2 min), even after prolonged infusion(4). The pharmacokinetic profile
      of remifentanil is independent of the hepatic (5) and renal function (6). And finally, the
      recovery profile of remifentanil is excellent with a speedy anesthetic emergence time which
      is important for a quick and proper neurologic assessment in the early postoperative period.

      Remifentanil produces good intraoperative hemodynamic control during intense noxious
      stimulation like laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and during pinning of the head (8).
      However, side effects of remifentanil include hypotension and bradycardia (15)
      intraoperatively, along with apnea(16,17) and hyperalgesia(18) postoperatively which is
      caused by increasing sensitivity to noxious stimuli. Investigations demonstrate different
      mechanisms of opioid-induced post-infusion anti-analgesia and secondary hyperalgesia (9).
      Overall remifentanil is a versatile opioid that is being increasingly used in the operating
      room.

      DEXMEDETOMIDINE (DEX), an alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist, is gaining popularity in
      neuroanesthesia. It has a desirable neurophysiologic profile including neuroprotective
      characteristics through its effect on α2A receptor subtypes (10). Its hypnotic effect is
      mediated through the α2 receptors in the locus ceruleus and its analgesic properties are
      mediated through an effect on the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (11,12). Since it has
      sympatholytic and antinociceptive properties, it may improve hemodynamic stability at
      critical moments of neurosurgical stimulation. Dexmedetomidine reduces anesthetic drug and
      opioid requirements in the perioperative period (13,14). In addition, dexmedetomidine does
      not affect evoked potential monitoring, (19) making it a favorable anesthetic adjunct in
      cases in which neurophysiologic monitoring is being used. In recent years, dexmedetomidine
      has emerged as an effective drug useful in a wide range of anesthesia related areas.

      Study Questions We postulate that dexmedetomidine provides better hemodynamic control in the
      intra- and post-operative periods and reduces PACU analgesic requirements.

      Primary Hypothesis 1: Intraoperative dexmedetomidine provides better postoperative analgesia
      than remifentanil, thus reducing PACU opioid requirements.

      Primary Hypothesis 2: Dexmedetomidine causes fewer hemodynamic perturbations than
      remifentanil.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the artesunate-amodiaquine combination is
      effective in treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children with severe
      acute malnutrition.

      Infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality in malnourished children. Malnutrition is known to have a modulating effect on the
      incidence of malaria infections, its severity and effectiveness of treatments. However,
      little data exists on antimalarial drug efficacy in malnourished children.
      Artesunate-amodiaquine combination is the first line treatment used in Médecins Sans
      Frontières programmes in Niger. The assumption of current efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine
      is based on non malnourished children. The aim of this study is to measure the clinical and
      parasitological efficacy in severely malnourished children.

      The study is consistent with the standard WHO protocol for monitoring antimalarial drug
      efficacy (WHO: Methods for surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy. Geneva; 2009), except
      for one inclusion criterion. Severe acute malnutrition is an inclusion criteria, instead of
      being an exclusion criteria. The study will encompass a pharmacokinetic part that will
      provide important information on the absorption of the drug.

      The study aims to examine the effect of buprenorphine on suicidal ideation in individuals
      with opioid use disorder, and to investigate the functional brain activity related to its
      potential anti-suicidal effect.
    ",Anti-suicidal Effects of Buprenorphine in Opioid Use Disorder,"['Opioid-use Disorder', 'Suicidal Ideation']","['Opioid-Related Disorders', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'Suicidal Ideation']","
      The current opioid epidemic is an urgent public health problem, contributing significantly to
      the climbing U.S. suicide rates over the past two decades.

      Although initially rewarding, chronic opioid use leads to tolerance and escalating negative
      affective states. This may promote suicidal ideation and may further impair decision-making
      functions leading to suicidal behavior.

      Buprenorphine, a treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), has promise in reducing suicidal
      ideation. However, the neural mechanism of its anti-suicidal properties remains unknown.
      Blocking kappa opioid receptors is one mechanism of buprenorphine hypothesized to reverse the
      negative emotional sensitivity in OUD and thus may underlie its anti-suicidal effects.

      In this morphine-controlled study, we will examine the effect of buprenorphine on the
      functional activity of brain regions involved in negative emotional reactivity and
      investigate whether this effect is associated with its anti-suicidal properties.

      Buprenorphine has a different mechanism of action than currently available antidepressants
      and anti-suicidal medications. Understanding this mechanism can help refine its use in this
      context. Success will guide a future larger study to elucidate molecular mechanisms
      underlying anti-suicidal properties of buprenorphine.

      This is an open label, randomized controlled study. We'd like to access the safety and

      transplantation patients. Our primary endpoints are kidney related indicators and secondary
      endpoints are glucose and lipid metabolism related indicators and adverse events. We are
      going to recruit 35 patients for each group and follow six months.
    ",Efficacy and Safety of Empagliflozin in NODAT,"['New Onset Diabetes After Transplant', 'Kidney Transplant; Complications']",Diabetes Mellitus,"
      In recent years, with the development of transplantation technology and immunosuppressive
      agents, kidney transplantation has made considerable progress. However, for metabolic
      disorders after kidney transplantation, such as new diabetes after kidney transplantation,
      there is still insufficient awareness. Since 1964, Starlz et al. first discovered and
      proposed New-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation（NODAT） in patients after renal
      transplantation. Scholars from all countries have paid considerable attention to it. The
      Chinese guidelines indicate that NODAT can increase the risk of graft-related complications,
      such as rejection, graft loss and infection, and ultimately affect the long-term survival of
      the recipient. In addition, NODAT has also been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular
      events, and cardiovascular disease is associated with more than half of kidney transplant
      deaths. A retrospective study of 567 renal transplant recipients in China showed that the
      incidence of NODAT was 24.2%. It can be seen that the incidence of new-onset diabetes after
      renal transplantation is high and has long-term adverse effects on transplant patients.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate and investigate NODAT's therapeutic drug
      regimens.

      According to the study, empagliflozin has a protective effect on the kidney and
      cardiovascular system, but it has not yet been written into the treatment guidelines for
      new-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation. Metformin and linagliptin are frequently
      used in diabetics after renal transplantation, and linagliptin also have a protective effect
      on the kidneys. Therefore, this experiment wanted to compare the effects between
      empagliflozin and linagliptin on kidney protection.

      Our department has done research into skeletal muscle function in patients with liver
      cirrhosis. Post-hoc analyses of one of these studies suggested that treatment with
      spironolactone had a positive effect on muscle strength and endurance. This effect was
      probably caused by an increase in concentration of Na, K-pumps (sodium-potassium pumps)
      enabling the muscle cell perform better.

      To verify this finding we have designed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial with skeletal muscle strength, -endurance, Na, K-pump content, cardiac
      systolic, and diastolic function as primary endpoints. Spironolactone is tested against

      function-tests, muscle biopsy and trans-thoracic echocardiography is performed before and

      Lidocaine has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. It has been shown to reduce early
      postoperative pain and nausea. Additionally, lidocaine has been shown to have positive
      effects in the recovery of bowel function, with a reduction in time to first flatus, first
      bowel sounds, first bowel movement, and is associated with a reduction of ileus. Because of
      these facts, lidocaine infusion has become part of enhanced recovery pathways after bowel
      surgery at our institution and others.

      There are few trials examining the use of lidocaine for orthopedic procedures and many of
      these studies have contradictory adults. An article by Martin et al. found no benefit in pain
      or recovery after total hip arthroplasty. By contrast, Farag and colleagues found that

      University of Vermont Medical Center was revised in 2015, a lidocaine infusion was added to
      the protocol.

      Studies for lidocaine use in minor lumbar surgery are scant. In one study of 50 patients in
      Korea, patient pain scores and fentanyl consumption were significantly lower in the lidocaine
      infusion group (1.5 mg/kg bolus plus 2 mg/kg/hr infusion) at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after
      surgery. Of note, the Cleveland Clinic Outcomes group is currently enrolling 440 patients in
      a study in which half will receive lidocaine and ketamine infusions.

      A reduction in opioid use may lead to the potential reduction of opioid-related side effects,
      such as nausea, constipation, and hyperalgesia, as well as more serious consequences such as
      respiratory depression and abuse. There is also the possibility of a length of stay reduction
      which has potential financial benefits.

      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study involving patients undergoing one- or
      two-level posterior lumbar instrumented spinal fusion with or without decompression.

      The University of Vermont Medical Center operating rooms will be utilized for this
      investigation. For the study group, we plan to prospectively recruit 140 patients 18-75 years
      of age. Recruitment will be done by the participating orthopedists and neurosurgeons, from
      their own patients. After an informed consent discussion, patients will be randomly assigned
      to receive 1 mg/kg lidocaine bolus and intraoperative infusion of 2 mg/min (intervention arm)
      or no lidocaine (control arm). All patients will receive adequate pain control medication
      according to their needs. Subjects will complete the 15-question Quality of Recovery
      assessment at baseline and at 36 and 60 hours after surgery. Using the electronic medical
      system, the following information with extracted: Total morphine equivalent used in house at
      36 hours, total morphine equivalents used at 60 hours, visual analog scale pain scores at 4,
      8, 12, 24, 36, and 60 hours, length of stay, incidence of nausea requiring medication, time
      to first flatus, and time to first bowel movement. Subjects will receive a patient-controlled
      analgesia pump for the first 36 hours after surgery.

      Randomization will be performed by the University of Vermont Medical Center Investigational
      Pharmacy Drug Service (IDS). IDS will generate a table of random numbers and assign those
      numbers in a 1:1 ratio of active drug to placebo, in blocks of 4. Following informed consent,
      a member of the study team will notify IDS, which will prepare syringes for the bolus dose
      and a bag for the infusion, both containing either active drug or placebo. The syringes and
      bag will be labeled with the subject's name, medical record number, and randomization number.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of human dental pulp to capping with
      MTA and NEC by histology and immunohistochemistry, using fibronectin and tenascin as markers,
      following 2 weeks and 8 weeks.
    ",Immunohistochemical Study of Human Teeth Pulp Capped With Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Novel Endodontic Cement (NEC),Direct Pulp Capping,,"
      Capping of the exposed pulp is indicated for reversible pulp tissue injury after physical or
      mechanical trauma in developing or mature teeth.The response to direct pulp capping with
      materials such as MTA or NEC is the formation of dentin barrier, resulting from the
      recruitment and proliferation of undifferentiated cells.

      Different materials can be used to induce dentinal bridge formation.MTA has been introduced
      as a proper material to induce dentinal bridge formation,with greater mean thickness of
      dentinal bridge and less inflammation compared to traditional materials like calcium
      hydroxide. Although biocompatible, MTA has a poor handling characteristic, delay setting
      time, off-white color, and it is almost expensive.The Novel Endodontic Cement (NEC) has been
      introduced to combine reasonable characteristics of MTA with appropriate chemical properties,
      setting time, color, and handling characteristics.

      The extracellular matrix (ECM) of pulp comprises a variety of proteins and polysaccharides,
      forming a neat network. The ECM components can induce either reactionary or reparative dentin
      formation. Fibronectin (FN) and tenascin (TNC) are the two major glycoproteins involved in
      wound healing and odontogenesis.

      Fibronectins (FNs) are a class of high molecular weight adhesive proteins composed of two
      very large subunits. It has a variety of cell functions, such as adhesion, migration, growth,
      and differentiation. Furthermore FN may be involved in the polarization and migration of
      odontoblasts.

      Tenascin is a large oligomeric glycoprotein of the ECM secreted by fibroblasts and glial
      cells in tissue cultures. It has also been identified in pulp and more prominent in
      dentinogenesis. TN has been shown to be important in the differentiation of odontoblasts.
      Therefore, it may be associated with secondary dentin formation, when pulp cells
      differentiate into odontoblasts in response to physiologic stimuli.

      Although dentin bridge formation has been reported,using different materials such as MTA and
      NEC in direct pulp cap, but the exact mechanism is not well understood. Immunohistochemistry,
      using different markers, may be useful in developing the molecules involved in this process.

      Moreover,response of dental pulp to different pulp capping materials can be studied,including
      mean thickness of dentinal bridge, morphology of dentinal bridge, and intensity of pulp
      inflammation and presence of odontoblast cells.

      Bronchiolitis is the most common respiratory infection of the lower respiratory tract that
      affects 11-12% of infants in their first year of life. Approximately 1-2% of patients with
      bronchiolitis require hospital admission because of poor feeding and/or breathing
      difficulties. The standard treatment for bronchiolitis is represented by oxygen-therapy and
      hydration while neither steroids nor epinephrine nor bronchodilators are recommended. One of
      the techniques of administration of oxygen in bronchiolitis is represented by the high flow
      (HFNC) or by a system in which oxygen is delivered to 2L/kg through nasal cannulas. The HFNC
      provides humidification, heating and oxygen, ensuring a minimum positive pressure, reduces
      breathing load and allows for better nutrition. The main aim of therapy with high flows is to
      reduce the days of oxygen therapy and the cases of intubation. However, up to now, there have
      been few studies on the use of HFNC in Pediatric Emergency Units. The Cochrane review on this
      topic, updated in May 2013, included only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a pilot
      study of 19 subjects comparing HFNC with oxygen administered via ""head box"". The oxygen
      saturation was higher in children HFNC after 8 (00% versus 96%, p=0.04) and 12 hours (99% vs
      96%, p=0.04) but similar in both groups at 24 hours. The authors concluded that the available
      evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of HFNC.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate in a large number of cases the effectiveness of
      treatment with high flow versus standard treatment, in children with bronchiolitis referred
      to a Pediatric Emergency Department.

      The objective of this research study is to better understand patterns of recovery after Total
      Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) amd Total Hip Replacement (THA). The study will evaluate how pain,
      activity and cognitive (i.e., thinking style) responses determine patterns of recovery, and
      the study will evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin versus placebo for improving recovery
      after surgery.
    ","Predicting, Understanding and Speeding Recovery After TKA","['Pain', 'Total Knee Replacement', 'Total Hip Replacement']",,"
      The investigators propose a two-site, longitudinal, double-blind, randomized clinical
      intervention study to examine three specific aims:

      Aim 1: Characterize the dynamic pain experience, activity, and cognitive response after TKA
      and determine patterns of recovery in these domains

      Aim 2: Test whether gabapentin alters time course of recovery after TKA or THA in a manner
      dependent on its interaction with pre-drug pupil diameter and preferred style in the
      catastrophizing-optimism dimension

      Aim 3: Test whether gabapentin increases pupil diameter in patients undergoing TKA or THA who
      are on high dose opioids preoperatively and to examine whether opioid use moderates the
      associations in Aim 1

      Primary Hypothesis: Novel variance beyond established associations in recovery from pain
      following TKA or THA surgery is accounted for by the interaction between pupil diameter and
      Cognitive-Affective (C-A) state, and this interaction predicts efficacy of gabapentin to
      speed recovery.

      Key secondary hypotheses: Disability, impulsivity, and attentional deficits recover after TKA
      or THA surgery follow a log of time pattern, and are predicted by C-A state and its
      interaction with pupil diameter. Gabapentin increases resting pupil diameter in patients
      scheduled for TKA who are receiving high doses of opioids.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of a minimally invasive nasopharyngeal
      pH probe for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) in children with airway
      compromise; to determine whether it is comparable to the gold standard esophageal pH probe in
      identifying LPR in this population; and to correlate results of pH testing with validated
      questionnaires. Our hypothesis is that a nasopharyngeal pH probe is equivalent to an
      esophageal probe in identifying laryngopharyngeal reflux.
    ",A New Nasopharyngeal pH Probe for Diagnosis of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,"['Gastroesophageal Reflux', 'Laryngopharyngeal Reflux']","
      Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) has been repeatedly linked to upper respiratory symptoms in
      the pediatric population. Children with LPR may present with laryngomalacia, subglottic
      stenosis, laryngitis, and vocal cord nodules among other illnesses. Pharyngeal reflux has
      even been implicated in causing common childhood illnesses such as sinusitis and otitis
      media. Diagnosing LPR can be difficult, especially in children. Often otolaryngologists
      depend on a general gestalt to diagnosis LPR. In some cases, physicians rely on a Reflux
      Symptoms Index (RSI) questionnaire filled out by the caretaker and/or a Reflux Finding Score
      (RFS) filled out by the practitioner. Others have attempted to use a variety of tools to
      measure pH in the upper airway and proximal esophagus.

      Initial research focused on correlating gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with otolaryngologic
      illnesses. These studies relied mostly on esophageal pH probes placed at the lower esophageal
      sphincter. With the realization that extraesophageal reflux or LPR was a separate disease,
      new methods have developed to quantify it. The dual esophageal pH probe is the current gold
      standard for measuring LPR as it records pH just above the proximal esophageal sphincter.
      Conditions such as chronic pediatric sinusitis, otitis media, laryngitis and globus are
      believed to arise from laryngopharyngeal reflux. Unfortunately, this device fails to identify
      many patients with LPR who would benefit from treatment, and radiographic studies are limited
      by their short duration of evaluation and risk of radiation. In addition, the placement of
      the esophageal pH probe is relatively invasive requiring both sedation and x-rays to confirm
      placement. Finally, they are difficult to place and maintain in children, necessitating a
      hospital stay for 24 hours while data is collected. The alternative is empiric treatment with
      Histamine 2 blockers and/or Protein Pump Inhibitors for an extended course, which has been
      shown to improve symptoms in many of these patients but is not without risk.

      The new Dx-pH nasopharyngeal probe is the only tool available for directly measuring
      nasopharyngeal pH. It is an exempted class I medical device and is Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-approved for general use in the population. The device, manufactured by
      Respiratory Technology Corporation ISO (ResTech), measures the pH of both liquid and
      aerosolized droplets. It is positioned posterior to the soft palate and placement is
      confirmed by visualizing the light-emitting diode (LED) at the tip of the device. It is
      significantly less invasive than esophageal pH probes, does not require general anesthesia
      for placement, and can be used in an outpatient setting.

      The Dx-pH probe is currently being used clinically in adult and pediatric practices to
      diagnose and monitor laryngopharyngeal reflux with only limited research supporting its use.
      A literature review finds only 6 studies that address the Dx-pH probe, of which, only 1 pilot
      study has been performed in children. This study looked at changes in pH in the trachea of 3
      children with chronic tracheostomies. However, to date, no research has been published on the
      utility of the probe in diagnosing LPR in children. The probe, if effective, would be a
      valuable tool for diagnosing LPR in the pediatric population because of its limited risk and
      potential ability to replace more invasive and costly procedures.

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative condition affecting the macula or
      central area of the retina in elderly people. Early AMD is marked by the presence of soft
      drusen and/or retinal pigment abnormality (hyper- and hypopigmentation). Late AMD includes 2
      forms, nonneovascular (dry) AMD and neovascular (wet) AMD. Despite new medical and surgical
      interventions, AMD remains a leading cause of vision loss in elderly people all over the
      world.

      Ranibizumab is one of the most effective approaches of AMD management. Ranibizumab - a
      recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody Fab that neutralizes all active forms of vascular
      endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A) - has been evaluated for the treatment of AMD.
      Ranibizumab binds to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A. VEGF-A cause
      neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion, and
      is thought to contribute to the progression of neovascular AMD and macular edema following
      RVO. Prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface
      of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new
      blood vessel formation.

      There have been a number of studies that have examined a possible association between
      ranibizumab and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE). The ATE rate in the three controlled
      neovascular AMD studies during the first year was 1.9% (17 out of 874; 0.3-0.5 mg LUCENTIS)
      vs 1.1% (5 out of 441) in control arms (AMD-1, AMD-2). In the second year the ATE rate was
      2.6% (1323 patients; Lucentis 879) vs Control 444 (p < 0.05). The ATE rate in the two
      controlled RVO studies (RVO-1, RVO-2) during the first six months was 0.8% (789 patients;
      Lucentis 527 vs Sham 262).

      The investigators assume that ranibizumab can be rather dangerous in patients with history of
      coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular events. The main objective of study is to reveal
      contraindications for ranibizumab prescription in patients with history of coronary artery
      disease and cerebrovascular events. Moreover, an association between management with
      ranibizumab and ATE rate in healthy above 50 years old persons is a concern of great interest
      as well.

      It is often difficult to manage acute painful crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.
      The usual management of these crises relies on hydration, administration of oxygen and
      narcotics, like morphine. A select group of patients, for unknown reasons, does not respond
      to this management and these patients often require prolonged use (several days) of
      intravenous narcotics. Narcotics have proven to be ineffective in controlling this type of
      pain and can cause multiple side effects (sedation, vomiting, respiratory depression). We
      propose to administer intravenous ketamine in this group of patients who are resistant to
      intravenous narcotics. Ketamine has been proven to be effective in controlling pain in
      multiple clinical situations. However, there are no data in the literature describing its use
      in patients with sickle cell disease.

      People with type 2 diabetes experience heart failure more often than do people without
      diabetes. This may be due to increased stiffness in the heart as a result of diabetes. This
      study will examine whether exenatide, a medication used to treat diabetes, may have
      beneficial effects on the heart in people with type 2 diabetes and heart failure.
    ",Evaluating the Use of Exenatide in People With Type 2 Diabetes and Diastolic Heart Failure,"['Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Heart Failure, Diastolic']","['Heart Failure', 'Heart Failure, Diastolic', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2']","
      Diastolic heart failure is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the ventricles of
      the heart become stiff and do not fully relax, preventing the heart from properly filling
      with blood. The circulation of blood then backs up, and blood collects in the body's organs,
      primarily the lungs. However, people with diastolic heart failure may have a normal ejection
      fraction, which is a measure of the amount of blood that the heart pumps out with each heart
      beat. Having type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of diastolic heart failure. Also, people
      with both heart failure and type 2 diabetes are more likely to experience poor health and
      even death than are people with only heart failure. It is possible that diabetes leads to
      increased stiffness of the ventricles and the aorta, which is the main blood vessel into
      which the heart empties. Exenatide, part of a class of medications known as glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, is a new medication that is currently used to treat
      elevated blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Some studies have shown that this class
      of medications may have a positive effect on the heart and blood vessels. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the effect that exenatide has on aortic and left ventricular stiffness
      in people who have type 2 diabetes and diastolic heart failure.

      This 12-week study will enroll adults with type 2 diabetes and diastolic heart failure with
      normal ejection fraction. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical
      examination, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, a blood collection, an
      echocardiogram to obtain images of the heart, and a non-invasive test that measures blood
      flow in the aorta. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either exenatide or
      usual care. Participants who receive exenatide will inject the medicine twice a day for 12
      weeks. At Week 4, these participants will attend a study visit to adjust the medication
      dosage and to report any problems, and at Week 6, study staff will follow up with
      participants by phone. All participants will attend a study visit at Week 12 for repeat
      baseline testing.

      Background Intraoperative hypotension is a common problem that significantly contributes to
      perioperative mortality and morbidity. At the moment the ""gold standard"" for perioperative
      fluid management is the so called ""goal-directed therapy"" that features fluid resuscitation
      followed if necessary catecholamines if needed for perioperative cardiocirculatory support.

      Worldwide the so called ""physiological"" sodium chlorid (0.9% NaCl) solution is the most often
      used infusate for perioperative fluid management. Despite its widespread use physiological
      saline has its major disadvantages such as the increased incidence of metabolic acidosis.
      Nevertheless catecholamines have their significant side effects as well (eg diminished renal
      perfusion, increased cardiovascular morbidity) and they therefore should be used with
      caution.

      In a prior study by group members on patients undergoing renal transplantation receiving
      either physiological saline or an acetate-buffered infusate showed a 50% decrease in
      catecholamine necessity in the acetate-buffered infusate group. The investigators therefore
      would like to evaluate the effects of the perioperative fluid choice on the necessity of
      catecholamine use.

        -  Evaluation of the perioperative fluid choice on the necessity of catecholamines for
           cardiocirculatory support.

        -  Description of the relationship between perioperative fluid choice and minimal blood
           pressure as well as the time to catecholamine use and their dosage.

      undergoing major abdominal surgery at the Vienna General Hospital and Medical University of
      Vienna. Fluid management and catecholamine use will be based on a oesophageal Doppler -based

      The patella tendon is located in the knee, and is attached to the leg bone and the patella
      bone (knee cap). The quadriceps muscle (an important tight muscle) attaches to the patella
      bone and allows for extension and flexion of the leg. Rupture of the patella tendon occurs
      mainly in people under the age of 40 years old with an active lifestyle. Normally, surgical
      repair is needed to fix this injury. The widely accepted surgery for this injury consists in
      drilling 2 holes in the patella bone that are used to anchor the patella tendon in place.
      This surgery has some complications such as re-rupture of the tendon, breakage of the bone,
      etc. Some investigators have tried different techniques to avoid these complications with
      variable results. We want to use 2 anchors in the bone to avoid making holes in the patella
      bone, decreasing complications and surgical time, and hopefully, allowing for a better
      surgical repair. We will have 2 arms. One group will have the standard of care technique and

      The most important prognostic indicator for the breast cancer patient is the axillary lymph
      node status. With the introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, many women were spared
      the morbidity of a full axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) while having the axillary nodes
      assessed with a low false negative rate. Approximately 30% of women who undergo ALND
      experience shoulder/arm morbidity including numbness, pain, weakness and decreased range of
      motion. In addition, the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) held the promise that women
      with early stage breast cancer would be able to avoid the dreaded morbidity associated with
      axillary lymph node dissections including lymphedema, decreased range of motion and pain.
      Since the adoption of SLN, numerous papers have documented that SLN is superior to ALND.
      However, patients who undergo SLN still have a significant amount of pain with this
      procedure. There are few published studies which objectively assess the subjective and
      objective symptoms of SLND.

      Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      fractures and spinal fusion, relief of pain in acute sprains and whiplash injuries,
      improvement of skin blood flow, healing of venous stasis ulcers, and reduction of
      postmastectomy lymphedema. Indeed, radiofrequency PEMF devices are FDA approved for pain and
      edema relief. PEMF devices are economical and disposable, and can be incorporated
      unobtrusively in standard post-op dressings. We have recently reported, in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study on breast reduction, that post-op PEMF therapy produced a
      significant decrease in pain and pain medication use, along with a concomitant decrease in
      IL1-beta in the wound bed.1 The current pilot study will be designed to determine if PEMF
      treatment, given in addition to standard of care, can reduce post-operative discomfort and
      morbidity after lumpectomy and SLND, or lumpectomy and ALND. Lumpectomy and ALND/SLND
      patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study will undergo standard
      surgery, but will be randomized to one of two groups: the treatment group with a PEMF coil
      placed around the arm and the control group with a coil that delivers no PMF. We expect
      postoperative pain to be reduced in the PEMF-treated patients as well as improved arm
      mobility and strength. The use of PEMF might reduce the need for narcotic pain medications
      and their side effects of sedation, nausea, and vomiting. It may also reduce costs related to
      arm morbidity.
    ",Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF) and Post-Axillary Surgery Morbidity,Shoulder Symptoms After Lymph Node Dissection,,"
      In the treatment arm, the PEMF would be automatically delivered for 15 minutes every two
      hours for one month. The manufacturer (Ivivi Technologies, Inc., Northvale, NJ) has already
      designed a lightweight, disposable device that can be placed around the patient's arm and
      taped in place. The patient would keep the device in place for two weeks, when they return
      for a followup visit and receive a fresh device to wear for an additional two weeks.

    ",Left Atrial Thrombus Reduction - Effect of Dabigatran Versus Phenprocoumon,"['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Left Atrial Thrombosis']","['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Thrombosis']","
      Bakground and study rationale: Left atrial (LA) thrombi are found in 2.5 - 18% of subjects
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) depending on the subject population. Subjects with LA thrombi
      have a particularly increased risk for cerebral and peripheral embolism. Consequently, oral
      anticoagulation is recommended in those subjects. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is
      suited and is capable of visualizing and deecting LA thrombi. Cranial magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) has a high accurancy for detecting ailent cerebral mircoembolism. However,
      under continued effective anticoagulation with the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) Phenprocoumon
      we have shown that only 56% of LA thrombi resolve during a 12 months TEE observational
      period. At 1 month only 16% of the thrombi disappeared. However, cureent treatment guidelines
      recommend 4 weeks of effective anticoagulations prior cardioversion, independent of LA
      thrombus. In our subject population 84% of LA thrombi would have still been presented at 4
      weeks VKA therapy and thus, would have had an increased risk of thromboembolism, if
      cardioversion, in accordance with current guidelines, would have performed. It is well known
      that thrombin plays a central role in the formation, growth, maintenance, and consolidation
      of thrombus. Direct thrombin inhibition has been shown to block these processes and leads to
      inhibition of thrombus. In vivo, it has been shown to reduce 90% of the preformed,
      half-hour-old-thrombus. This effect is probably due to better inhibition of the catalytically
      active clot-bound thrombin. Newer oral anticoagulants, like the direct thrombin inhibitor
      Dabigatran are therefore very promising for resolution of LA thrombi in comparison to VKA,
      which has not been investigated previously.

      Efficacy variables: Expliration of possible differences for the reduction of left atrial
      thrombus size evaluated by TEE (primary) and silent cerebral embolism (secondary) detected by
      cranial MRI at baseline anf after a 12 month treated period with Phenprocoumon or Dabigatran
      in order to gain mire detailed information and to generate valid hypotheses for further
      clinical trials.

      Overview: This is a single-center, randomized, two treatment groups, open, phase IV clinical
      study in subjects with atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus. At visit 0 (Screening
      visit) subjects with left atrial thrombus established in TEE are eligable to entry in the

      The aim of this study is to determine if local wound infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine
      at the time of cesarean delivery can decrease opioid use and provide adequate post-operative
      pain control.
    ",Liposomal Bupivacaine After Cesarean Delivery,"['Pain, Postoperative', 'Opioid Use']","Pain, Postoperative","
      Specific Aim 1: To identify the effect of local infiltration of all wound layers with
      liposomal bupivacaine on opioid consumption up to 48 hours after cesarean delivery.

      For this aim, in-patient narcotic use, measured in morphine equivalents, will be documented
      by the nurses and totaled during each 24 hour period after cesarean section until discharge.

      Specific Aim 2: To identify the effect of local infiltration of all wound layers with
      liposomal bupivacaine on other, relevant, clinical outcomes, including time to first opiate
      use, time to mobility, occurrence of vomiting, use of rescue antiemetic medications, pain
      scores, and use of additional measures for pain control such as heating pads, muscle
      relaxers, gabapentin, between the study groups.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the occurrence of adverse events in the infants of breastfeeding
      women who have received local infiltration of all wound layers with liposomal bupivacaine
      compared to breastfeeding women who received saline infiltration.

      Study Methods:

      Patients will be randomized to either receive 20 mL liposomal bupivacaine diluted to 90 mL
      (treatment group), or 90 mL normal saline (control group). Patients with a BMI greater than
      or equal to 40 will receive 150 mL normal saline of the liposomal bupivacaine formulation.
      Randomization will occur in a 1:1 fashion via Miami Valley Pharmacy staff. All patients will
      be given the current medications used during cesarean delivery at MVH including Duramorph in
      the spinal or epidural via the Anesthesia team, Toradol for 24 hours on scheduled followed by
      Motrin on schedule until discharge.

      Instillation of the liposomal bupivacaine or saline will be performed by resident physicians
      supervised by Wright State or private attending physicians. For each study group, 45 mL of
      their given solution will be infiltrated into the sub-fascial layer after its closure. Using
      an 18-gauge needle, 10 mL aliquots will be instilled into each lateral edge and six 2-mL
      aliquots into the superior and inferior fascial edges.

      Post-operative care will first take place in the PACU in the usual fashion according to the
      anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologists will be blinded to the study group and patients will
      be given rescue parenteral opioids as deemed necessary.

      The primary outcome of this study will be total oral morphine equivalents at 48 hours from
      the time of surgery. Nurses blind to the study group will record the total amount of opioid
      medications each patient used. This will be converted to a morphine equivalent of 1mg oral
      oxycodone to 1.5mg oral morphine.

      Selection of Patients:

      Recruitment: Patients will be recruited from Miami Valley Hospital Labor and Delivery and
      from Five Rivers Center for Women's Health. Investigators will identify potential patients
      from those who are admitted to Labor and Delivery for a scheduled cesarean delivery.
      Investigators will explain the study to potential patients and will obtain written informed
      consent from patients who agree to participate in the study.

      Data Management Data required for the study will be recorded in the medical record by
      physicians and nursing staff. Physicians will document the procedure for infiltration in
      operative notes, indicating that the patient was randomized to ""active medication (Experel ®)
      or saline."" MVH Pharmacy staff will record the randomization/treatment key. Investigators,
      nursing staff, and patients will be blinded to the medication given. Documentation of pain
      scores, opioid medications used, other pain control methods used (heating pads, muscle
      relaxers, gabapentin, etc.) will be done by the physicians and nursing staff according to
      standard procedures. Data collection will consist of medical record review to record data on
      the paper data collection forms.

      Confidentiality of Data PHI will be limited to information needed for the study objectives.
      Patients will be assigned a study ID number on the paper data collection forms and in the
      spreadsheet. Patient name and MRN will be kept in a separate key that will allow
      re-identification only if necessary to complete data collection.

      Risks:

      There is a risk of a breach of confidentiality. Risks to the Mother: Liposomal bupivacaine
      (Exparel ®). Liposomal bupivacaine is FDA approved for use via wound infiltration for
      post-surgical pain control. The most common adverse events include nausea, constipation, and
      vomiting. There have been reports of adverse neurologic reactions with the use of local
      anesthetics. These include persistent anesthesia and paresthesia. CNS reactions are
      characterized by excitation and/or depression. Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac
      conductivity and excitability which may lead to dysrhythmias, sometimes leading to death.
      Allergic-type reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis and angioedema) are rare and may occur as a result
      of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients. There have
      been reports of chondrolysis (mostly in the shoulder joint) following intra-articular
      infusion of local anesthetics, which is an unapproved use. Cases of methemoglobinemia have
      been reported with local anesthetic use. 12 In a Cochrane Review of 20 studies that used
      local anesthetic wound infiltration after cesarean delivery, no adverse cardiovascular or
      central nervous system reactions were noted in any of the included studies. 9

      Risks to the Infant: Liposomal bupivacaine is contraindicated in pregnant women. Therefore,
      the use of this medication will occur after the fetus is delivered. Liposomal bupivacaine and
      its metabolite, pipecoloxylidide, are noted to be present in breastmilk in small amounts.
      There is no available information on effects of the drug in the breastfed infant or effects
      of the drug on milk production. The Infant Risk Center has indicated that it is highly
      unlikely for plasma levels in the infant to reach a toxic level due to any exposure from
      breastmilk and suggests that use of liposomal bupivacaine is probably compatible with
      breastfeeding without restriction. 3

      Potential Benefits: Patients may receive benefit from the study by experiencing better
      postoperative pain control or by reducing opiate medication use while maintaining acceptable
      pain control. The potential benefit to women in the future is to have an effective option for
      pain control after cesarean delivery that does not require opiate medications.

      Statistical Considerations: Based on a previous study performed at this institution in a
      similar patient population the investigators anticipate a 25% reduction in total oral
      morphine equivalents at 48 hours. Using a power of 0.80 and an alpha of 0.05 the
      investigators will need 54 patients per group, or a total of 108 patients in order to detect
      a difference of this size.

      Data Analysis: Analysis of the data will be performed by members of the investigative team
      using SPSS. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare pain pill (non-opioid) use,
      opioid pain pill use (in morphine equivalents) and pain scores over time for the study
      groups. Additional post hoc t-tests will be used as needed to identify specific group
      differences at the individual time points as appropriate. Potential covariates including
      parity, previous cesarean delivery, previous surgical history, and BMI will be examined for
      impact on opioid pain pill use and pain scores. Frequencies for adverse events in infants
      will be used to identify the occurrence of adverse events in infants exposed to liposomal
      bupivacaine versus those not exposed (including those who were not breastfed and those who
      were breastfed among mothers receiving the saline infiltration).

      Fibromyalgia is a common, chronic musculoskeletal disorder that is characterized by
      widespread pain and tenderness. Fibromyalgia occurs in around 2% of the US general
      population, is more common in women and is associated with substantial morbidity and
      disability. Treatment of fibromyalgia has been disappointing; roughly one-third of patients
      have had a clinically important therapeutic response to medications or no-medicinal
      treatment, event with the newest drugs reported in the literature. Pathophysiology of
      fibromyalgia is unknown, but abnormalities in central neurotransmission might play a role.
      Some studies have shown that salmon calcitonin increases peripheral and central levels of
      endorphins. Increasing endorphins levels may decrease pain. Then, it is feasible that nasal
      administered salmon calcitonin may decrease several of the symptoms and signs of patients

      This is an open label, multicenter study of an investigational formulation of HBP Lotion,
      0.05% in male and female subjects aged 12 to 16 years 11 months with stable plaque psoriasis.
      Approximately 25 subjects with stable plaque psoriasis on at least 10% of their BSA
      (excluding the face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas), who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled at multiple study sites. All subjects will have
      a screening CST to assess their HPA axis response at Visit 1 (Screening Visit).

      Enrollment into the treatment phase of the study should be timed such that the screening CST
      will be performed a minimum of 20 days before Baseline Visit. At Visit 2 (Baseline), eligible
      subjects with normal adrenal function will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Subjects will apply HBP Lotion, 0.05% to all psoriasis plaques identified at Visit 2 twice
      daily (approximately every 12 hours) for the assigned treatment period or until the
      investigator verifies the subject's psoriasis has cleared. The study is designed to determine
      the adrenal suppression potential and pharmacokinetic properties of the test article after
      the subject applies a maximum of approximately 50 grams per week for up to a two week
      treatment period. All subjects will have a CST to reassess their HPA axis response at EOS (or
      earlier if the investigator verifies the subject's psoriasis has cleared). In this study, an
      abnormal Hypothalamujs Pituitary Adrenal axis response to 0.25 milligram dose of cosyntropin
      is defined as a post-CST serum total cortisol level of less than equal to18 μg/dL.

      Eligible subjects will have blood drawn at Screening for baseline drug concentration in
      plasma. On Day 8, all subjects, regardless of lesion clearance, will have blood drawn for
      assessment of trough drug concentration in plasma. At the Day 15 visit, subjects who have
      continued to treat lesions will have a final PK blood sample collected approximately 12 hours
      after their Day 14 evening application and just prior to the initiation of the CST.

      In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) complicated with coronary artery disease (CAD),
      antiplatelet drugs are commonly used for the prevention of recurrence of stent thrombosis and
      cardiovascular events in combination with anticoagulant drugs. Based on the observations that
      the incidence of hemorrhagic complications increased when an antiplatelet drug was
      administered in combination with vitamin K antagonist (VKA), the guidelines for
      antithrombotic therapy after PCI in the US and EU recommend that DAPT (dual anti-platelets
      therapy) should be used in AF-complicated CAD patients for as short a time as possible
      following single anti-platelet and VKA, and that monotherapy with VKA should be started from
      one year after PCI. In 2013 the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) published the
      guidelines for the use of NOACs in NVAF patients, which state that NOACs may have advantage
      to VKAs in terms of anti-thrombotic effects in NVAF patients undergoing PCI. However, no
      clinical evidence has ever been generated to reveal the efficacy and safety of mono-drug
      therapy with a NOACs in stable CAD patients one year or more after PCI.

      AFIRE study is planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mono-drug therapy with a
      rivaroxaban in stable CAD patients. Among NOACs, rivaroxaban was chosen because of the
      evidence in Japanese patients and the results of a sub-analysis of ROCKET AF suggesting that
      rivaroxaban is more effective than VKA in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction
      (MI).

      Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent in schizophrenic patients, affecting up to 80% of men
      and women. Antipsychotic induced sexual side effects may be a barrier to treatment

      higher rates of causing prolactin elevations that may be implicated in sexual dysfunction.

      Sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs) are a family of glucose transporters expressed
      on the apical surface of epithelial cells in the intestines and kidneys. Their function is to
      actively transport glucose across epithelia into the blood. Members of the SGLT-family of
      transporters include sodium-dependent glucose transporters-1, -2, -3, and -4 (SGLT1, SGLT2,
      SGLT3 and SGLT4), with SGLT2 being the primary glucose transporter in the kidney. SGLT2
      inhibitors are a new class of anti-diabetic drug approved as treatments for type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM). These drugs inhibit SGLT2-mediated reabsorption of glucose in the renal proximal
      tubule -- thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion and decreasing plasma glucose levels.

      The study aims to evaluate a deescalating therapeutic strategy (switch the carbapenem to

    ",Deescalating Carbapenems in Hospital Setting,"['Urinary Infection', 'Digestive Infection', 'Biliary Infection', 'Expanded-spectrum Beta-lactamase Producing ESBL']","['Infections', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Urinary Tract Infections']","
      Carbapenems are considered the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of infections due to
      expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Their use is readily
      increasing because of the pandemic of ESBL-PE. However, the future of these drugs is
      challenged by the worldwide emergency of new resistance mechanisms in the same pathogens,
      particularly the carbapenemases. This resistance makes these drugs inactive and gives no
      therapeutic options for patients. Resistance to carbapenems is strongly associated with the
      use of these drugs, because of their large spectrum and strong impact on the host flora.
      Consequently, the correct use of these drugs is an important public health objective. In
      France, the CA-SFM (Committee on Antimicrobial of the French Society for Microbiology) has
      suggested alternative strategies with narrow spectrum beta-lactam for the treatment of
      ESBL-PE infections, including 3rd or 4th cephalosporins, cefoxitin and penicillins with
      beta-lactamase inhibitors. A recent analysis including 6 prospective cohort studies of
      bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing Escherichia coli did not find an excess of
      mortality or a longer length of hospital stay for patients receiving penicillin with
      beta-lactamase inhibitors, as compared to patients treated with carbapenems, after adjusting
      by confounding factors. As patients receiving carbapenems seem to be more severely affected,
      the efficacy and safety of the alternative strategy remain unproved. A randomized study is
      therefore needed to evaluate a deescalating therapeutic strategy (switch the carbapenem to
      another beta-lactam for which the isolated pathogen is susceptible) in patients with
      well-defined ESBL-PE infections (usual sites of infections and non severe infections). The
      objectives of the present study are to demonstrate that the alternative strategy of
      deescalating therapy is not inferior to a strategy maintaining the carbapenem in terms of
      clinical cure, survival, lack of relapse and microbiological cure.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether dabigatran reduces clopidogrel mediated ADP
      induced platelet aggregation measured by MEA as compared to phenprocoumon after a two-week
      treatment with either agent.
    ",Impact of Dabigatran and Phenprocoumon on Clopidogrel Mediated ADP Induced Platelet Aggregation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation,"['Coronary Heart Disease', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Atherosclerosis']","['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Heart Diseases', 'Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Coronary Disease', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Myocardial Ischemia']","
      Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (OAC) is the standard care for reducing
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Just recently the direct, competitive thrombin
      inhibitor dabigatran has been approved by the FDA for stroke prevention in patients with
      atrial fibrillation. In a large multicenter trial it was shown that dabigatran was at least
      as effective as Vitamin K antagonists in the prevention of stroke without an increase of
      major hemorrhage.

      Approximately 6 % of patients who undergo coronary stenting and need DAT with aspirin and
      clopidogrel need in addition OAC for the reduction of cardiac, cerebral and systemic
      thromboembolic events5. These patients will therefore need triple therapy, a therapy which is
      associated with increased bleeding complications. Although phenprocoumon given solely without
      clopidogrel has no impact on ADP induced platelet aggregation, it has been shown that
      phenprocoumon significantly attenuates the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel.

      ADP induced platelet aggregation measured with multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA)
      is a marker for the efficacy of the clopidogrel therapy and (i) a low response (AUC ≥ 468) to
      clopidogrel has been associated with an increase of ischemic events such as stent thrombosis
      and (ii) patients with an enhanced response to clopidogrel (AUC ≤ 188) have higher bleeding
      rates.

      It is therefore crucial to evaluate whether an additional antithrombotic therapy such as
      dabigatran alters clopidogrel mediated ADP induced platelet aggregation. While it has been
      shown that intravenous administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin further
      reduces ADP induced platelet aggregation in patients on clopidogrel therapy, it is unknown
      whether dabigatran has also an impact on ADP induced platelet aggregation.

      To evaluate the impact of dabigatran on ADP induced platelet aggregation we will randomize
      patients with atrial fibrillation and the need for oral anticoagulation and current
      clopidogrel therapy for a two-week treatment with either dabigatran or phenprocoumon and we
      hypothesize that dabigatran is superior to phenprocoumon in the reduction of ADP induced
      platelet aggregation. Patients who are not concomitantly treated with clopidogrel are being
      studied in a different trial with a similar study design (Dabi ADP-1).

      Our routine practice for patients undergoing mastectomy is to include paravertebral
      peripheral nerve blockade for postoperative analgesia. This study investigates whether the
      addition of another nerve block targeting the pectoral nerves will improve that analgesia.
    ",Pectoral Nerve Blockade in Mastectomy,"['Postoperative Pain', 'Breast Cancer']","Pain, Postoperative","
      Randomization:

      20 patients will be randomized into 2 groups. Both groups will receive paravertebral blocks
      with 4 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine at each of six levels.

      Group A: Active group with 10 cc of 0.375% ropivacaine (16) pectoral nerve block Group S:
      Placebo group with 10 cc of normal saline for pectoral nerve block

      Blinding:

      The injectate contents for the lateral pectoral nerve block will be blinded to all personnel
      involved in performing the block, all personnel involved in the general anesthesia and all
      personnel involved in assessing the patient for pain in the postoperative recovery period.

      Procedure:

      All study patients will be consented for a paravertebral block and a lateral pectoral nerve
      block as per institutional standards. Pre-block procedure will follow the standard operating
      procedures of the institution including time out, intravenous access, oxygen supplementation,
      electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter and automated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring.

      Paravertebral block will be performed as usual, as described by Moller (17). Patients will be
      in a sitting position with a staff member standing in front of the patient to ensure safety.
      The surgical site will be marked both in the front and on the back of the patient with dual
      confirmation from the consent and the patient. Mild sedation will be given using midazolam 2
      mg and fentanyl 100 µg. The superior aspects of the spinous processes of thoracic levels
      C7-T5 will be identified with palpation. The needle entry site will be marked at 2.5 cm
      lateral to each spinous process ipsilateral to the operative breast. Using a 22-gauge, Tuohy
      needle (B Braun Medical Inc, Bethlehem, PA, USA) attached via extension tubing to a syringe,
      the needle will be advanced anteriorly in the parasagittal plane (perpendicular to the back
      in all directions) until it contacts the transverse process. The needle will then be
      withdrawn to the subcutaneous tissue and angled to walk off the caudal edge of the transverse
      process. From the caudal edge, it will then be advanced anteriorly approximately 1 cm. (17)
      After negative aspiration of the syringe, 4 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected at each
      of the six levels. These injections correspond to the T1-T6 spinal root levels.

      The lateral pectoral nerve block is performed as described by Blanco (15). A linear
      ultrasound probe (L28 sonosite, Seattle, WA, USA) will be placed in a sagittal paramedian
      fashion inferior to the lateral third of the ipsilateral clavicle medial to the coracoid.
      Once the pectoralis major muscle and axillary artery is identified, the thoraco-acromial
      artery is identified between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscle and confirmed
      with color Doppler. The lateral pectoral nerve is consistently located adjacent to the
      artery. (15) Ten mL of study injectate (16) will be delivered using an in-plane technique via
      a 80 mm echogenic (Pajunk, Germany) needle adjacent to the artery and into the inter-pectoral
      plane. Care is taken to avoid intramuscular and intravascular injection. The contents of the
      injectate will be blinded to any personnel involved in performing the block, general
      anesthesia, or post operative care.

      All patients will proceed with general anesthesia. Induction will be with propofol and
      maintenance with desflurane. Airway management will be with an LMA without use of muscle
      relaxant as per standard practice. Fentanyl will be used intraoperatively to treat pain.
      Hydromorphone will be used to treat pain in the post- operative setting. No NSAID or
      acetaminophen will be given in any route. For prevention of post operative nausea and
      vomiting, all patients will be given a 1.5mg scopolamine patch, 8 mg of dexamethasone at the
      beginning of surgery,(18) and 4 mg of ondansetron at closing.

      Any supplemental local anesthetic infiltration by surgeons will be noted.

      Assessment:

      Standard post anesthetic care unit assessment (PACU) of numerical rating pain scale score
      will be performed as per standard protocol. Hydromorphone will be used to treat pain in the
      post-operative setting. If pain control is inadequate, other analgesics may be prescribed at
      the discretion of anesthesia providers involved in the case as per standard practice.
      Additional anti-emetics may be prescribed and used whenever necessary.

      Data collection includes total preoperative, intraoperative fentanyl and total post-
      operative hydromorphone. Data collection concludes when the patient has met PACU discharge
      criteria or 2 hours after arousal, whichever is sooner. Time of PACU admission and when the
      patient has met PACU discharge criteria is recorded. Any supplementary local anesthetics or
      analgesia will also be noted. Prior to PACU discharge, a blinded assessor will assess the
      patient for any reduced sensation to cold in the distribution of the radial, ulnar, median
      nerves in the hand and musculocutaneous nerve in the arm as well as the motor integrity of
      the 4 said nerves. Patient grip strength will be measured on the surgical and contralateral
      sides with a grip dynamometer. Three iterations of measurements will be taken prior to the
      nerve block procedure and again when the patient is ready for discharge from PACU.

      Patient satisfaction will be assessed at PACU discharge with a standard question, ""Thinking
      about your nerve blocks, how satisfied were you with them: where 1 is not at all, 4 is in the
      middle, and 7 is completely satisfied?"" scored on a 7-point Likert scale.

      Any complications will be noted, with follow up and management as per the institution
      standard operating procedure. Known risks of regional anesthesia include small risks of
      infection, swelling and bleeding, and extremely rare risks of nerve damage, collapsed lung,
      seizure, and death. Unanticipated adverse events will also be reported to the PI for
      evaluation and possible reporting to the HRRC, according to HRRC policy.

      Statistical analysis:

      Demonstrating that non-blocked patients' analgesic requirements differ from the hypothesized
      mean for blocked patients at α=0.05 and 80% power will require a total sample size of 16
      (8/group). This estimate is based on observational data for non-blocked patients from our own
      practice, and our estimate of the minimum clinically-significant difference in analgesic
      requirements to be expected in blocked patients. We currently estimate that enrollment of 20
      participants should be sufficient to accumulate 16 who complete the protocol , and will apply
      to HRRC for an amendment to enroll more should that be necessary.

      Statistical analysis of most outcomes (opioid consumption, pain score, time to discharge)
      will be carried out with Wilcoxon tests or t-tests, as appropriate. The remaining outcomes
      (PONV incidence, incidence of weakness or modified sensation in ipsilateral upper limb) will
      be analyzed with proportion tests.

      Caudal injection of local anesthetic is a neuraxial technique routinely performed on young
      children for postoperative analgesia after lower abdominal and lower extremity surgical
      procedures. One of the major limitations of the use of single shot neuraxial injections for
      this purpose is the limited duration of action of the injected local anesthetic. Adjuvant
      medications, such as clonidine and epinephrine, have been added to the local anesthetic to
      prolong the duration of the neuraxial block, with varying results. Dexamethasone is a
      synthetic glucocorticoid steroid commonly used in the perioperative setting for a multitude
      of indications, including the prolongation of local anesthetic based analgesia. It has been
      shown that the administration of dexamethasone either intravenously or via perineural
      injection can significantly increase the duration of analgesia derived from a local
      anesthesia based peripheral nerve block. Literature also suggests that the effect of
      dexamethasone is equivalent whether given intravenously or perineurally. Interest in
      dexamethasone enhanced caudal analgesia exists and a previous study noted that caudal
      anesthesia can be prolonged by intravenous dexamethasone. The study was criticized for using
      a higher dose of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) than is routinely used in the pediatric population
      outside of airway procedures, which may expose patients to dose related side effects of
      dexamethasone. A large meta-analysis has suggested that 0.1 mg/kg is effective for analgesic
      prolongation, but no direct study of low dose intravenous dexamethasone in combination with
      caudal anesthesia has been performed.
    ",Low Dose IV Dexamethasone in Prolonging Caudal Anesthesia in Children Undergoing Genitourinary Surgery,Surgery,,"
      As dexamethasone is an inexpensive and commonly used medication, it would be beneficial to
      know if a similar prolongation of analgesia occurs when a local anesthetic is given
      neuraxially in combination with low dose intravenous dexamethasone. This project will
      investigate the efficacy of low dose intravenous (IV) dexamethasone in prolonging the
      duration of post operative analgesia provided by an intraoperative caudal injection of local
      anesthetic. All patients will be enrolled in the study the day of surgery, in the
      preoperative waiting area. The study will be explained by an anesthesiologist with extensive
      knowledge of the protocol. Computer randomization will occur for each patient. Randomization
      will not increase the risk to either group as all medications and techniques utilized for
      this study are commonly accepted for routine care for these patients.

      Introduction: Colonoscopy is an important tool for colon cancer screening. Proper colon
      cleansing is essential to ensure adequate mucosal examination. Timing of bowel preparation
      administration is now recognized as an important component for achieving superior cleansing.
      Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have found split-dosing to be
      superior than day-before dosing. Objective: This study aims to compare two types of bowel
      preparations in split-doses to assess for differences in patient tolerability, as well as
      efficacy of colon cleansing. Methods: This is a prospective, single-blinded,
      randomized-controlled trial. Patients who are being referred for a colonoscopy will be
      recruited to participate in the study. They will be randomly assigned to receive either a
      split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) or picosalax (P/MC) bowel preparation. Patient
      tolerability will be examined through questionnaires. The endoscopist performing the
      colonoscopy will use two standardized bowel preparation scoring systems to evaluate the
      quality of the cleansing. The investigators propose that P/MC will be superior to PEG in
      patient tolerability and non-inferior in bowel cleansing effects.

      There still remains the question if hepatitis C eradication with all oral therapy will lead
      to a regression or cure of the low grade lymphoma. Thus, the hypothesis of this study is that
      oral HCV therapy will lead to a high rate of hepatitis C eradication which will correlate
      with a reduction of the size and extent of low-grade lymphoma. The hypothesis of this study
      is that subjects with hepatitis C,regardless of genotype, who have low grade lymphoma, when
      treated for hepatitis C without pegylated interferon will have a regression of low grade
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this pilot study we will evaluate the effect of
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir or sofosbuvir/ribavirin based antiviral therapy on the course of a
      subset of HCV-related low grade B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

      Primary Objective This study will assess the safety, as measured by adverse events, in
      subjects receiving hepatitis C treatment.

      Secondary Objective The secondary objective of this study is to assess the rate of overall
      response of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma defined as either as partial response or complete
      response according to revised international working group criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Primary Endpoint Safety and tolerability of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir or sofosbuvir/ribavirin in
      subjects with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will be assessed by number of adverse events and
      serious adverse events. In addition, the study will assess the number of subjects who had to
      stop treatment due to adverse events or serious adverse events. The study will also examine
      the number of subjects in which treatment for lymphoma had to be given due to clinical
      progression.

      Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoint(s) of this study is to (1) Assess the rate of
      overall response of B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma defined as either as partial response or
      complete response according to revised international working group criteria for non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma. (2) Determine the rate of sustained viral response in subjects with low-grade
      lymphoma.

      Methods and Study Design

      The study will plans to enroll approximately 21 subjects over the next 6-12 months for this
      study.

      Subjects with low grade lymphoma with confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis C with a viral load >
      1000 will be included in this study. Subjects may be treatment naïve or experienced to
      hepatitis C therapy, however subjects must be treatment naïve to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      treatment to be included in this study. All subjects will undergo staging studies at the time
      of study screening which will include a whole body scans and a bone marrow biopsy. In those
      with a prior bone marrow biopsy, those who had bone marrow involvement and biopsy was <3
      months from screening, then an additional biopsy is not needed. If bone marrow biopsy did not
      show bone marrow involvement, a repeat bone marrow biopsy is needed at screening. If complete
      data is not available from a prior biopsy, a repeat bone marrow biopsy will need to be done.
      In addition, patients will have staging of liver disease by serologic markers of liver
      inflammation, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio (APRI) and
      FibroTest® or (Fibro Sure®) or FibroScan®. If these methods are inconclusive, then a liver
      biopsy may be obtained to determine if the patient has cirrhosis. Patients will be treated
      regardless of stage of fibrosis. The rationale for examining cirrhosis is that these patients
      may not respond as well and will require further surveillance for hepatocellular cancer every
      6 months. Additionally, hepatitis C viral load and genotype will be determined prior to
      initiation of hepatitis C treatment.

      Setting:

      This will be a multi- center study conducted at University of Texas Southwestern Medical
      Center, Cornell Medical Center, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Each site would
      be expected to enroll 7 subjects in 6-12 months.

      weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks. Weight-based ribavirin refers to use 1200 mg of
      ribavirin in divided doses for those ≥75 kg and 1000 mg in divided dose for those <75kg.

      The following obstetric procedures are commonly performed with spinal anesthesia on labor and
      delivery: bilateral tubal ligation, external cephalic version, cerclage insertion, cerclage
      removal, minimally invasive fetal surgery, and evacuation of retained products of conception.
      Bupivacaine is currently the standard spinal medication for these procedures because of its
      long history of safe use, its low incidence of transient neurologic symptoms, and its ability
      to provide a dependable, dense block with a high degree of maternal satisfaction. While
      bupivacaine has the aforementioned advantages, it unfortunately has a long duration of
      action, up to 240-380 minutes, which far exceeds the time necessary to complete most
      obstetric procedures. Clorotekal®, the first Food and Drug Administration approved
      chloroprocaine solution created for spinal injection, is a potential alternative. When
      compared with bupivacaine spinals, chloroprocaine spinals have been shown to facilitate
      clinically significant shorter times to resolution of motor and sensory block, first
      ambulation, micturition, and discharge readiness. The objective of this study is to determine
      if a strategy of spinal anesthesia with chloroprocaine will reduce the duration of motor
      block, compared with equivalent block with hyperbaric bupivacaine..
    ",Comparison of Clorotekal and Bupivacaine for Short Obstetric Surgery,"Anesthesia, Spinal",,"
      This will be a single-blind, randomized, controlled, single center clinical trial assessing
      the efficacy of spinal chloroprocaine on resolution of motor block and associated patient
      flow through the post-anesthesia care unit . Fifty patients will be equally randomized to
      receive either spinal chloroprocaine or hyperbaric bupivacaine.

        1. Subject

        2. Obstetric provider

        3. Investigator

        4. Outcomes assessor

      The anesthesia provider will be unblinded.

      Subjects will be allocated to either intrathecal injection of 50 mg of 1% chloroprocaine or
      10.5 mg (1.4 mL) of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine. The intrathecal space will be accessed with
      a 25 gauge Whitacre needle. Upon obtaining cerebrospinal fluid, the syringe of study solution
      will be attached the end of the Whitacre needle. The syringe will be pulled back to reveal
      aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid. The study solution will then be administered over
      approximately 5 seconds. The Whitacre needle and spinal introducer needle will be removed
      from the patient's back. The patient will be placed supine on the operating room table. The
      outcomes assessor will then be allowed to enter the operating room.

      Decisions on when to administer additional sedative and analgesic medications will be left to
      the discretion of the anesthesia team. The level of block will be initially assessed by the
      anesthesia team. When the block is felt to be at peak height the outcomes assessor will test
      with pinprick to determine the peak block height.

      In accordance with standard of practice at our institution all patients will have convective
      warmers used during the case and patient temperature will be monitored. Non-invasive blood
      pressures will be obtained every 2.5 minutes after spinal placement. The frequency of blood
      pressure measurement will be changed to every 5 minutes, 15 minutes after spinal placement.
      Anesthesia providers will administer phenylephrine via intravenous bolus to maintain maternal
      blood pressure within 20% of baseline or for a systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg.
      Anesthesia providers will be allowed to add ephedrine or glycopyrrolate to phenylephrine for
      maternal hypotension with co-existent bradycardia.

      A research coordinator will remain with the patient throughout their time in the operating
      room and the post-anesthesia care unit. Active, non-standard of care, monitoring for the
      following signs and symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity will occur in the operating room
      and post-anesthesia care unit at the following time intervals after spinal placement: 5
      minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, upon post-anesthesia care unit arrival, upon completing
      Phase 1 of post-anesthesia care unit recovery, and upon discharge from the post-anesthesia

           Hg)

        -  Arrhythmias

      The research coordinator will obtain from anesthesia, upon arrival to the post-anesthesia
      care unit, the total dose of intraoperative opioids administered, whether the patient had
      intraoperative hypotension, and the total dose of intraoperative phenylephrine administered.
      In the post-anesthesia care unit, the research coordinator will determine the patient's
      Bromage scale score at 5-minute increments. The research coordinator will also ask the
      patient to notify them when they have a Bromage scale score of 2 (able to flex knees). While
      in the post-anesthesia care unit, the research coordinator will also document the time of
      post-anesthesia care unit arrival, the end of Phase 1 of post-anesthesia care unit recovery,
      and the time that the patient leaves the post-anesthesia care unit (end of Phase 2).

      The research coordinator will meet with the patient on the evening of their surgery as well
      as daily for the duration of their hospitalization to assess for time of first ambulation,
      bladder catheterization, and for adverse events including, new postoperative neurologic
      deficits and any other potential adverse events.

      To gather information on the incidence of new postoperative neurologic deficits all patients
      will be called 1 week after spinal insertion. A telephone script will be used to obtain this
      information.

      Chronic knee pain from osteoarthritis (OA) is commonly treated with total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA) when conservative therapies fail to provide pain relief. More than 600,000 TKAs are
      performed in the U.S. annually, a number that continues to increase. A logistic-regression
      model suggests that the incidence rate of TKA will increase by 143% in the United States by
      2050 compared to 2012. Although TKA is successful in reducing knee pain and joint stiffness
      in most cases, it can be associated with a 7-35% incidence of persistent refractory
      post-surgical knee pain.

      To determine whether chemical neurolysis of the genicular nerves with 6% aqueous phenol is

      replacement.

      Uterine leiomyomata, also known as fibroids, are an extremely common benign lesion being
      present in 30-50% of all women. Traditional surgical treatment of symptomatic fibroids has
      been hysterectomy in post child bearing woman. However, over the last decade, the use of a
      minimal invasive technique called uterine artery embolization has become increasingly popular
      due to high patient satisfaction, cost effectiveness, and shorter recovery period. The
      purpose of this randomized blinded placebo controlled study is to compare pre-emptive
      analgesia vs non-preemptive analgesia for immediate postoperative pain control, long term
      pain control, and improved quality of life in woman following uterine artery embolization
      surgery. The study consists of four drug groups including a placebo group. The addition of
      pregabalin and celecoxib together with epidural analgesia may improve pain management as well
      as leading to a better post-procedure outcome in women following uterine artery embolization.

      Many investigators believe that the ischemia in the normal myometrium is the primary source
      of pain immediately following surgery making postoperative pain management challenging.
      Epidural fentanyl may offer an advantage when encountering visceral pain. In addition to
      being an effective analgesic for chronic pain syndromes, the use of pregabalin provides
      effective postoperative analgesia when it is administered pre-emptively before an operation.
      Preemptive analgesia involves the introduction of an analgesic regimen before the onset of
      noxious stimuli, with the goal of preventing sensitization of the nervous system to
      subsequent stimuli that could amplify pain. In human trials, pregabalin has been demonstrated
      to reduce pain, improve sleep, and mood disturbances in patients with post herpetic
      neuralgia. The use of celecoxib in combination with pregabalin has shown to provide more
      effective analgesia by providing antihyperalgesia. Therefore, the addition of pregabalin and
      celecoxib together with epidural analgesia may improve pain management as well as having an
      effect on long term sequelae.

      COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 is a frequent
      concern across hospital settings in Canada and is associated with substantial morbidity and
      mortality. This clinical trial is initially designed to evaluate the role of monoclonal
      antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, for the treatment of hospitalized patients
      who acquire COVID19 via nosocomial infection. New treatments, as they become available, may
      be integrated, with appropriate adaptation of this document. The trial was initiated with the
      bamlanivimab product with the options of casirivimab/imdesimab and sotrovimab added as the
      prevalence of bamlanivimab resistant variants of concerns increased.

      It is believed that monoclonal antibody treatments are most likely to be effective early in
      the disease course. The ability to rapidly identify and initiate such treatments in patients
      with nosocomial acquisition of the infection, combined with the high mortality of 25-30%
      experienced by this group of patients led us to propose this trial in collaboration with the
      CATCO national network.

      The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and clinical effectiveness of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment relative to the control arm, in patients who
      develop nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, on need for mechanical ventilation or death.

      This study is designed as a pragmatic randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care (control) or the study
      medication on a 1:2 basis. Bamlanivimab, casirivimab/imdesimab or sotrovimab will be
      administered intravenously as a one-time infusion after randomization. Casirivimab/imdesimab
      (REGN) and sotrovimab will be the default agents based on local availability unless both are

             the infant(s) who is/are not enrolled would likely receive OPV through routine
             immunization and transmit vaccine poliovirus to the enrolled infant. Even if all
             births from a multiple birth could be enrolled in the study, we will exclude multiple
             births as discontinuation of one may lead to discontinuation of multiple participants.

          -  Infants from premature births (<37 weeks of gestation).

      Objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a multimodal therapy on the basis of
      current guidelines on fall prevention consisting of a 12-months intervention with
      Alfacalcidol and calcium, patient education and a mobility program in a group of patients 65
      years of age or older with an impaired renal function in comparison to a group receiving
      usual care.

      The risk of falling increases with age. An impaired renal function is an additional risk
      factor. Guidelines and systematic reviews suggest, that multimodal interventions are most
      likely to control this risk. This study evaluates, if patients at high risk for falls will
      benefit from a multimodal intervention simple and feasible enough to be transferred into
      general practice. Participants will be randomized either into an intervention group or a
      control group receiving usual care.

      The multimodal intervention consists of:

        -  medication: Participants receive 1µg Alfacalcidol and 500mg Calcium daily

        -  mobility program: strength, balance and gait training twice a week for one hour

        -  patient education: a single meeting with teaching lessons on risk factors for falling
           and modes of fall prevention followed by an evaluation of the individual fall risk and
           corresponding recommendations to reduce it
