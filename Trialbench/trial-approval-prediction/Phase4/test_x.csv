      The objective of this study is to determine whether 12 weeks of mesalamine therapy added to a
      standard HIV treatment decreases systemic immune activation and inflammation in HIV-infected
      patients, possibly resulting in better recovery of the immune system. The study hypothesis is
      that decreasing inflammation directly in the gut may decrease both of these potential causes
      of chronic inflammation, potentially resulting in an immunologic benefit.

      Heart failure is a major health problem in Canada. Recent advances in medical and device
      therapy have helped to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with this problem.
      Among these treatments, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has very recently been shown
      to be effective to improve functional class, quality of life and exercise tolerance of the
      patients with the most severe symptoms of heart failure and a prolonged duration of the QRS

      Severe influenza respiratory disease is increasingly recognized in children. Influenza
      hospitalization rates in high-risk infants, such as premature infants, are increased some
      five-fold over rates in other children. The recently-licensed live attenuated influenza
      vaccine (LAIV) promotes better immune responses than the trivalent inactivated vaccine, but
      can cause wheezing. The balance of risks and benefits for LAIV in extremely premature
      infants, who may be at increased risk for both influenza disease and vaccine side effects, is
      unknown.

      The specific aim of this project is to compare the immune response and reactions of
      trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and live, attenuated, intranasal influenza
      vaccine (LAIV) in groups of former premature (PT), very (V) LBW and former full-term (FT)
      infants aged 24-35 months.

      The investigators hypothesize that the immune response in FT infants will be greater with
      LAIV than TIV, and that wheezing episodes will be no more than twice as frequent in LAIV as
      in TIV recipients.

      The study will enroll 14 former premature, VLBW infants and 14 former full-term infants.
      Children will be randomized to receive one dose either TIV or LAIV. Vaccine reactions will be
      measured. One to two teaspoons mL of blood will be drawn at 0 and 7-14 days from
      immunization, and less than one teaspoon of blood will be drawn at 28-42 days.

      Chronic sinusitis is reported to be one of the most widespread disorders in the United
      States. It can be caused by a variety of reasons such as allergy, infection and/or defects in
      T-cells which help regulate immune function. Medication and other costs related to treatment
      of nasal and sinus infections are estimated to be more than $60 million annually putting a
      considerable strain on the economy of health care.

      Probiotics are live microorganisms that are normally present in the gut of a healthy
      individual. They are also known as ""friendly bacteria"" and have been used to help maintain
      the normal functioning of the immune system. They are safe and are commercially available in
      the form of yoghurt, sachets, chewable tablets or flavored capsules. Since a number of nasal
      and sinus disorders are related to allergy and improper functioning of the immune system, we
      hypothesize that regular use of probiotics may help improve chronic nasal and sinus symptoms
      by boosting immune responses.

      The project we propose is novel because it would be the first study evaluating the usefulness
      of probiotics for the larger population having chronic sinusitis rather than those having
      only allergic symptoms. We aim to assess whether regular use of probiotics will help improve
      symptoms of chronic sinusitis and will have a greater effect than placebo in this regard.

      The investigators want to see whether the test drug in this research study,
      2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (2HPBCD), might potentially be able to improve cough in
      healthy volunteers. The investigators are initially recruiting healthy volunteers such as who
      are free from any respiratory disease and not on any concurrent medication, so there are no
      confusing effects from pre-existing respiratory symptoms or disease, nor interaction of any
      medication with the test drug.

      Background. Antihypertensive therapy with ß-blockers (ßBs) and diureticts (Ds) is accompanied
      by a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) than therapy with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or
      angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Whether this difference is due to an antidiabetogenic
      action of ACEIs and ARBs or to the fact that these agents are free of the diabetogenic
      activity of ßBs and Ds is unknown. Prevention of DM as well as of HT is of primary health
      concern.

      Objectives. The primary objective of PHIDIAS is to test whether in individuals with
      components of metabolic syndrome making them predisposed to DM and HT, addition of either an
      ACEI or an ARB to periodically reinforced lifestyle counselling can reduce 1) onset of DM and
      2) onset of HT significantly more than lifestyle plus placebo. Secondary objectives are 1)
      comparing the antidiabetogenic effects of ACEI and ARB, and 2) investigating whether the
      effects of ACEI and ARB on DM and HT persist at least 6 months after treatment withdrawal.

      Methods. PHIDIAS is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-arm comparison trial.
      300 general practitioners (members of SIMG with the assistance of hospital centres of SIIA)
      will randomise 6000 untreated individuals aged 40-75 years, with SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89
      mmHg, fasting glucose (FG) 100-125 mg/dl, waist circumference >= 102 (M) or >= 88 cm (W), to
      three blinded treatments, given in addition to lifestyle advise: 1) Placebo; 2) the ACE
      Enalapril (10 mg, then 20 mg od); 3) the ARB Losartan (50 mg, then 100 mg od).Double-blind
      treatment will be maintained until 500 cases of DM are observed (presumably average of 36
      months) (Treatment Phase: control visits, BP, FG every 6 months). This will be followed by a
      6-month Withdrawal Phase (active treatment substituted by placebo). Primary outcomes are DM
      (FG >= 126 mg/dl) and HT (SBP >= 140 or DBP >= 90 mmHg) on 2 consecutive visits. PHIDIAS will
      be governed by a Steering Committee assisted by a blinded Event Adjudicating Committee and an
      independent DMSB.

      Expected results. The sample size is adequate (alfa 5%, power 90%) to evaluate whether
      incident DM (expected rate 3.5%/year) or incident HT is reduced 25% by ACEI and ARB versus
      placebo (primary hypothesis) and whether either the ACEI or the ARB reduces incident DM by
      30% more than the other agent.

      Rationale: the use of antiplatelet drugs (i.e. clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) is
      crucial in the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with
      stent implantation to prevent atherothrombotic events. Ticagrelor and prasugrel are more
      effective in preventing atherothrombotic events, but with a higher risk of bleeding
      complications, compared to clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is converted into its active metabolite
      by CYP2C19. Carriers of the non functional CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles have an impaired CYP2C19
      capacity, making clopidogrel less effective. For these subjects ticagrelor or prasugrel is an
      alternative.

      Objective: to assess the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the CYP2C19 genotype
      guided antiplatelet treatment strategy, using clopidogrel in non-carriers of a CYP2C19*2 or
      *3 allele and ticagrelor or prasugrel in carriers of a CYP2C19*2 or *3 allele in STEMI
      patients.

      Intervention: the intervention group will be genotyped for CYP2C19*2 and *3 allele variants
      within 48 hours after primary PCI. Carriers will receive either ticagrelor (90 mg twice
      daily) or prasugrel (10 mg once daily or 5 mg once daily if the patient is older than age 75
      or has a body weight less than 60 kg), according to local standards. Non-carriers will be
      treated with clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). The control group receives either ticagrelor or
      prasugrel, according to local standards at the same dosage as the CYP2C19*2 or *3 carriers in
      the intervention group. The antiplatelet drug will be continued for one year after PCI. The
      follow-up duration will be one year using follow-up questionnaires.

      Although several large well designed clinical trials have shown that erythropoietin which is
      commonly used to treat anemia associated with kidney disease, increases the risk of stroke
      and heart disease, the mechanism for this increased risk is unknown. The investigators'
      preliminary studies show that the adverse effects of erythropoietin are from activation of

      This study evaluates the addition of polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM) to compression
      therapy to determine effectiveness in improving the healing of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) in
      adults with severe venous disease of the great saphenous vein (GSV). All participants will
      receive treatment with Varithena and compression therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the use of PEM to correct superficial axial
      and varicose vein reflux is effective in improving healing of VLUs, over treatment with
      compression alone.

      Assessment of the antitumour effect of zoledronic acid in patients with multiple myeloma and
      asymptomatic biochemical relapse

      It´s proposed to investigate the use of Zoledronic acid as single therapy in patients with
      Multiple Myeloma in biochemical relapse. The following must be noted:

        -  Patients with no formal indication for chemotherapy treatment will be included, as
           patients with symptomatic myeloma who after responding show biochemical relapse are
           generally not treated. This allows for generating both a group of patients untreated, on
           no additional treatment and a treatment group on zoledronic acid.

        -  As these are relapsing symptomatic patients, their number is far higher than patients
           with quiescent Multiple Myeloma. This allows for expecting a good enrolment.

        -  There are few reliable data on symptom progression after biochemical relapse, though it
           is one of the new objectives occurring in almost all clinical trials on myeloma. In the
           VISTA study, it has been estimated that the median time to the new treatment is 5 months
           (combining progression-free time and time to the next treatment). This time is much
           shorter than the median quiescent myeloma progression-free survival, so a very long
           follow-up time will not be necessary in this patient group.

        -  The administration of this drug to these patients can help prevent skeleton-related
           complications in the future, the study of which will be a secondary objective of this
           study.

      This 2 x 2 sequential factorial study evaluates two potential improvements to the standard
      immunosuppression regimen used at the investigators' institution to prevent rejection of
      transplanted kidneys. These two potential improvements are each applied in sequence to half
      of the study patients, creating 4 study arms; the other half receive the standard treatment.
      The two potential improvements are:

        1. Administering the immunosuppression induction agent rATG (""rabbit anti-thymocyte
           globulin"") in a single dose at the time of transplantation, instead of in the usual
           series of 4 smaller doses over 6 days.

        2. After 6 months, modifying the maintenance immunosuppression used to prevent rejection by
           replacing the drug tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

      The two interventions, spaced sequentially six months apart, enable independent analysis of
      the two treatments so long as it can be shown that there is no synergistic interaction
      between them.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a nutritional
      supplement, the probiotic bacteria GanedenBC30. Probiotics are live microorganisms which when
      taken in large enough amounts are supposed to provide a health benefit. The investigators
      would like to see whether this supplement can be used as a treatment for Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome (IBS) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Participants in the study will have both
      IBS and MDD. In order to find out if GanedenBC30 is effective in treating IBS and MDD, the
      investigators will compare it to a placebo. About 32 people will take part in this research
      study. About half of these 32 people will take part at Charles River Medical Associates and
      half will take part at Burlington Medical Associates. Participants will be recruited from
      among patients already being seen at Charles River Medical Associates or Burlington Medical
      Associates for their primary care. The study will last for two months, during which time
      participants will make eight study visits and will take either Ganeden BC30 or placebo. The
      investigators hypothesize that subjects treated with the probiotic will have significantly
      better outcomes with regard to depression and IBS symptoms compared to those who receive
      placebo.

      2. Clinical hypothesis.

        1. UDCA increases GLP-1 response to nutrients via provoking bile acids excretion from the
           liver to the intestine/colon.

        2. UDCA improves glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.

           type 2 diabetes.

        6. The combination therapy may loose weight by unique mechanisms of each agent; GLP-1
           inhibits appetite by acting on CNS and gastrointestinal motility, whereas UDCA-enhanced
           circulating primary bile acids increases energy expenditure through the pathway
           involving G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (Gpbar1, or M-Bar, TGR-5) and

      Metformin is the first-line treatment for medical management of Type 2 Diabetes. Up to 25% of
      patients experience significant gastrointestinal symptoms and in approximate 5%, side-effects
      result in the discontinuation of metformin. It would be of great clinical significance if the
      underlying cause of this intolerance was identified.

      Recent data has highlighted a metformin transporter in the gut - Organic Cation Transporter
      1(OCT1) - as a potential culprit for the variability in metformin tolerance. Across a
      diabetic population, up to one in four people were shown to have a single reduced function
      allele for OCT1, with approximately 8% having two reduced function alleles. This may increase
      the risk of the individual experiencing metformin-associated side-effects, potentially due to
      accumulation within the cells lining the intestine. The investigators aim to show that loss
      of function of OCT1, either due to genetic variation or drug inhibition of OCT1, may lead to
      an increase in the symptoms associated with metformin intolerance.

      The study is being undertaken at the Clinical Research Centre in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee.
      The investigators will recruit participants from the GoDARTS study (Genetics of Diabetes and
      Audit Research Tayside Study). The participants will be healthy controls, i.e. non-diabetic,
      and recruited according to their genotype of OCT1 (information from GoDARTS). The volunteers
      will then enter a matched cross-over study with two treatment periods. Metformin is taken
      during both treatment periods alongside either Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor used to
      prevent excess stomach acid, known to interact with OCT1) or placebo. The metformin dose is
      increased gradually during each period, to a maximum tolerated dose. The investigators expect
      to see a lower maximum tolerated dose in individuals with loss of function genotype, or in
      those taking concurrent omeprazole compared to placebo. The study will last approximately 9
      weeks. Volunteers have 3 visits to the CRC, and weekly phone call interviews.

      diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have shown that high levels of persistent systemic
      inflammation predict the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in HIV-infected
      persons on cART (a group at very high risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction).
      Bydureon has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in prior studies of non-HIV
      infected persons, which suggests that this agent may represent a unique and preferred
      medication for the treatment of insulin resistance in HIV-infected adults. The Investigators
      hypothesize that short-term (16 weeks) therapy with Bydureon will improve glucose tolerance
      and significantly reduce circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      highly-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), two biomarkers strongly implicated in the
      development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in diabetic, HIV-infected, cART-treated
      adults.

      Over time, patients with fibrosing or interstitial lung disease (ILD) can develop high lung
      blood pressures (pulmonary hypertension), and this is associated with poorer prognosis and
      survival. It is thought that development of PH contributes to the deterioration and death of
      patients with ILD. Endothelin-1 (ET1) is a substance contributing to the development of both
      PH and ILD. Bosentan is a drug blocking the action of ET-1 by binding to its receptors.
      Bosentan clearly benefits patients with PH of unknown cause, or related to other diseases
      (such as heart conditions, or HIV) both alone and in combination with other treatments. In
      patients with fibrosing lung disease and PH, there have been no controlled treatment studies.
      Clearly it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of bosentan in these patients.

      This study aims to determine the ability of bosentan to reduce high blood pressure in the
      lungs (pulmonary hypertension) in patients with scarring (fibrosing) lung disease. It is a

      in a 16 week open-label phase with bosentan therapy).

      Continuous right ventricular (RV) pacing demonstrates harm in patients with normal left
      ventricular (LV) function as well as in patients with cardiomyopathy and clinical heart
      failure. However, little is known about RV pacing in patients with advanced heart failure
      treated with an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The univentricular support
      provided by contemporary continuous flow LVAD's has improved outcomes for many advanced heart
      failure patients, yet the incidence of RV failure in the early post-operative period
      following implantation is associated with significantly reduced survival and increased length
      of stay. Acute LVAD unloading of the left ventricle has adverse effects on RV shape and size
      that contribute to post-operative RV failure. By promoting RV synchrony, RV overdrive pacing
      may counteract these adverse mechanical alterations, improving RV systolic function and
      ultimately LVAD function.

      The investigators will recruit all patients referred for an implantable, continuous flow LVAD
      at Duke University Medical Center who have an existing implantable dual-chamber
      cardioverter-defibrillator. Patients will be prospectively randomized into two cohorts to
      compare continuous right ventricular pacing vs. native ventricular conduction at equivalent
      heart rates. Multiple clinical outcomes will be examined over a two week period
      post-operatively including invasive hemodynamics, vasoactive medication use, end-organ
      function, RV function by Echocardiography as well as patient symptoms and functional status.

      Background: There are no proven therapies specific for Covid-19. The full spectrum of
      Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild respiratory tract illness to severe
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. The
      efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial.

      Methods: This is an internationally (Spain, Canada, China, USA) designed multicenter,
      randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial testing dexamethasone in mechanically
      ventilated adult patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by confirmed
      Covid-19 infection, admitted in a network of Spanish ICUs. Eligible patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either dexamethasone plus standard intensive care, or standard intensive
      care alone. Patients in the dexamethasone group will receive an intravenous dose of 20 mg
      once daily from day 1 to day 5, followed by 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. The
      primary outcome is 60-day mortality. The secondary outcome is the number of ventilator-free
      days at 28 days. All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle.

      This is a single-arm, open-label and post-authorization study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy profile of sorafenib and to evaluate Child-Pugh status progression in subjects with
      advanced HCC treated with sorafenib in Taiwan.

      In a subgroup of patients (hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) study subgroup), this study also
      aims to test if topical corticosteroids as preventive counter-measure applied to hands and

      Injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) into the bladder is a widely used treatment option
      for patients with overactive bladder who have failed medical therapy. Urinary tract infection
      is the most common side effect of this procedure and therefore antibiotics are given around
      the time of injection in order to prevent these events. While antibiotics are commonly given
      at the time of injection, the duration of these antibiotic regimens are variable. The
      investigators propose a study to investigate different antibiotic protocols and their affect
      on the rate of urinary tract infection after injection.

      Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension with orphan drug designation. Sildenafil modulates the nitric
      oxide (NO) pathway in the vessel wall. Since this pathway is impaired in pulmonary arteries
      of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), we hypothesized that sildenafil might improve pulmonary hemodynamics and
      increase exercise tolerance in this condition. However, in COPD sildenafil may also impair
      gas exchange due to the inhibition of pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction. The research

      It has been demonstrated that the nitric oxide production is reduced in type 2 diabetic

      It is not known if the use of NuvaRing® alters these innate and inflammatory biomarkers of
      inflammation.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis is that NuvaRing® will alter inflammatory biomarkers of inflammation, such as
      vaginal defensin and cytokine levels, resulting in an overall anti-inflammatory milieu in the
      vagina.

      Specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Determine biomarkers of inflammation, including defensins and cytokines, concentrations
           in women with normal vaginal flora (Nugent Score 0 - 3) before and after NuvaRing® use

        2. Determine changes in the integrity of cervicovaginal epithelium and leukocytic
           concentration before and after treatment with NuvaRing®

        3. Monitor for changes in the Nugent score before and after NuvaRing® use

        4. Assess the antimicrobial activity of vaginal fluid before and after NuvaRing® use

        5. Assess HIV infectivity ex vivo on biopsy specimens before and after NuvaRing® use

      About 10-30% of all patients with hip fracture have only insufficient analgesic effect of a
      femoral nerve block. One of the possible causes of this failure to provide analgesia from a
      single nerve block could be the that other nerves occasionally are involved in transmitting
      the pain signal. One of the nerves that is believed to give off branches to the hip is the
      obturator nerve.

      This study is being conducted in men scheduled to undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided
      prostate biopsy (TRUSP). Traditionally prior to prostate biopsy, an antibiotic,
      ciprofloxacin, has been given to men to prevent biopsy-related infections. In recent years as
      ciprofloxacin resistance has increased in the community, more and more men are becoming
      infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria after prostate biopsy. This study is being
      done to determine if obtaining rectal swab cultures and choosing antibiotics based on these
      culture results will result in fewer infectious complications than giving all men
      ciprofloxacin.

      The investigators will compare 2 groups: men whose rectal swabs do not show
      ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive ciprofloxacin prior to biopsy, and men whose
      swabs do show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive alternative antibiotics based on
      their culture results. Our hypothesis is that these 2 groups will have equal numbers of
      post-biopsy infectious complications and both groups will have fewer infectious complications
      than a historical group who received empiric ciprofloxacin without the benefit of rectal swab
      culture results.

      Introduction:

      The pharmacodynamic properties of enoximone could be beneficial for patients with an Acute
      Exacerbation COPD (AE-COPD). This research will focus on patients suffering of a severe
      AE-COPD and the bronchodilatory and inotropic effects of lower doses of enoximone. The main
      objective of the pilot study is to investigate if there is a bronchodilatory effect of
      enoximone in patients with AE-COPD. Secondary objective is to investigate a dose
      responsiveness in a range between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg enoximone.

      Methods:

      The study design is a prospective interventional non-randomized clinical series study
      involving patients admitted and intubated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with an AE-COPD.
      Patients will receive three times a dose of 0.5 mg/kg enoximone with a one-hour-interval. The
      primary objective is a reduction in auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) after
      enoximone compared to baseline. A dose-titration will test for dose dependency. Secondary
      objectives are a reduction in ventilator pressures, a reduction in pulmonary artery pressures
      and an increase in cardiac output.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective intraarticular steroid dose for
      the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The investigators aim to randomize patients
      into low, medium, and high dose groups of injectable corticosteroids as these doses are
      typically used in the standard of care for our patients. To date there has been no study to
      evaluate which dose is most efficient with the fewest side effects for glenohumeral
      osteoarthritis. The investigators objective will be to provide ultrasound guided
      intraarticular glenohumeral injections of these randomized concentrations and to evaluate
      pain and function before and following injection with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index
      (SPADI). The investigators hypothesize that the low dose steroid will provide equivalent
      improvement of the pain and function to the medium and high doses, while minimizing side
      effects.

      Functional MR is caused by adverse left ventricular remodeling after myocardial injury and
      associated with an increased incidence of heart failure and death. Because secondary
      functional MR usually develops as a result of LV dysfunction, diuretics, beta blockers,
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and
      aldosterone antagonists are given to patients with functional MR in line with the guidelines
      in the management of heart failure. However, functional MR appears to remain common despite
      use of these drugs and current medical treatment is usually insufficient for reducing MR or
      reversing the adverse LV remodeling. As LCZ696 is a dual-acting inhibitor of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), LCZ696 has
      greater hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects than ARB alone. Investigators try to examine
      the hypothesis that LCZ696 is superior to ARB alone in improving functional MR in patients
      with LV dysfunction and functional MR.

      CT. Gadolinium has been used extensively in MRI exams but the dose that is used is not
      sufficient to provide good enhancement on CT. Dual Energy CT is a new technology that has
      better sensitivity to lower doses of intravenous contrast and the investigators aim to study
      its effectiveness in improving the enhancement with Gadolinium. The investigators will
      compare enhancement of Iodine with enhancement of Gadolinium during Dual Energy CT, to assess
      the possibility that Gadolinium could be used as an alternative for patients who are
      suspected of having Pulmonary embolism. They will recruit up to 50 patients who are having a
      routine Chest CT during treatment for a malignancy and administer Gadolinium contrast and
      Iodine contrast during a chest CT exam. The enhancement with the two agents can be compared.

      Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by impaired arterial function and high
      incidence of cardiovascular events. Metformin and most recent antidiabetic groups of drugs,
      SGLT2 inhibitors, were in previous studies shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Until now,
      direct effect of empagliflozin on arterial function and its comparison to metformin was not
      studied yet.

      Aim: The aim of the present study is to explore and compare potential direct effects of
      empagliflozin and metformin on arterial functional and structural arterial wall
      characteristics in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      Methods: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are randomized into four groups: 1)
      empagliflozin (25 mg daily), 2) metformin (2000 mg daily), 3) combination (empagliflozin 25
      mg daily and metformin 2000 mg daily) and 4) control (placebo). At inclusion and after 12
      weeks treatment, arterial function is assessed: endothelial function (brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD), reactive hyperemia index (RHI)) and arterial stiffness (carotid
      pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) and common carotid artery stiffness

      Azathioprine (AZA) and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were developed over 50 years
      ago by Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings and were initially used clinically in the
      management of childhood leukemia and organ transplantation.

      The first case report of 6-MP use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was from 1962 , and
      since then the use of thiopurines has been well established in the management of moderate to
      severe IBD.

      Thiopurines offer an inexpensive and effective treatment option for maintenance of remission
      of IBD in comparison to biological agents which may be 30 times more expensive .

      Although 50-60% of IBD patients respond to thiopurines, a significant proportion of patients
      will not tolerate them due to various adverse effects . The adverse effects of thiopurines
      may be dose related, patient related or idiosyncratic.

      The immunosuppressive effects of thiopurines also increase the rates of opportunistic
      infections.

      Thiopurines are also associated with a higher rate of malignancies, particularly a malignant
      Burkitt-like lymphoma, related to Epstein-Barr virus infection . Other adverse effects of
      thiopurine relate to allergic phenomenon.

      An idiosyncratic adverse effect of thiopurine use is acute pancreatitis (AP).

      Acute inflammation of the pancreas defined by INSPPIRE criteria:

      requiring 2 of:

        1. Abdominal pain compatible with AP

        2. Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal

        3. Imaging findings of AP

      Drug induced AP is the assumed diagnosis when no other cause of AP can be found, the patient
      is taking a drug known to be associated with AP, and symptoms resolve after drug
      discontinuation. If pancreatitis re-occurs on re-exposure, the drug is definitely considered
      the cause.

      While drugs are considered a rare cause of AP and most cases are mild and self limited ,
      there is an 8 fold higher risk of AP in IBD patients treated with AZA . Thiopurine induced AP
      is usually detected within 4 weeks of starting treatment.

      However in the case of thiopurine induced AP, there has been no clear understanding of the
      mechanism.

      Thiopurine induced AP is generally considered an indication to cease thiopurine therapy, due
      to the assumed risk of recurrence of AP on reintroduction.

      There exists several case reports and anecdotal evidence that reintroducing thiopurines
      following an assumed thiopurine associated AP can be well tolerated.

      The investigators hypothesize that AZA and/or 6-MP can be safely reintroduced in the
      management of IBD patients following thiopurine-induced pancreatitis.

      If in the past the patients were treated with AZA, they will now be commenced on 6-MP, and if
      in the past they were treated with 6-MP, they will be commenced on AZA.

      Patiromer add-on to a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) in patients with Type 2
      diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) will reduce blood pressure and left
      ventricular (LV) mass to a greater extent compared to patients with MRA alone and favorably
      affect key secondary hemodynamic and inflammatory variables including atherosclerosis
      progression.

      Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Type II diabetes. A cell
      type called the monocyte/macrophage is critical to development and complications of
      atherosclerosis.

      This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a medication called Spironolactone in
      addition to Patiromer in preventing atherosclerosis in Type II diabetes through its effects
      on cells such as the monocyte. Spironolactone has been demonstrated to be effective for the
      treatment of patients after a heart attack and stroke. The investigators will evaluate the
      impact of Spironolactone in combination with Patiromer in reducing atherosclerosis plaque and
      additionally evaluate its potential in changing inflammation.

      The investigators envision that a strategy of simultaneously probing effect of a drug
      combined with analysis of mechanisms of action and predictive response will likely provide
      key information with which to design hard event (heart attack, stroke etc.) based trials.

      opiates are the analgesic mainstay for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients reporting
      peri-procedural pain or nitrate-resistant chest pain. However, large observational studies
      suggest that opiate administration during ACS may result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
      Complimenting this, a number of recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated delayed and
      attenuated effects of oral dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) on platelet inhibition endpoints
      among subjects receiving intravenous morphine. These studies support the hypothesis that
      morphine delays the gastrointestinal absorption of DAPT medications. However, no data exist
      on the impact of intravenous fentanyl, a systemic opioid analgesic routinely administered
      during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, on the platelet inhibition
      effects of DAPT. The investigators hypothesize that, similar to morphine, fentanyl
      administered at the time of PCI will reduce and delay the effect of DAPT on platelet
      function. As such, the primary aim of this study is to test the impact of intravenous
      fentanyl on residual platelet reactivity by randomizing patients undergoing PCI to a strategy
      of peri-procedural benzodiazepine plus non-systemic local analgesia or to the current
      standard of benzodiazepine plus intravenous fentanyl. Given the critical need for rapid and
      robust inhibition of platelet function during PCI, this trial has true potential to change
      clinical practice, particularly if the investigators demonstrate reduced DAPT absorption and
      elevated residual platelet reactivity among patients receiving fentanyl during PCI.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate pain responses from two different approved medications
      (ketamine and fentanyl) in the treatment of pain after rattlesnake envenomation (RSE). Both
      medications are currently used in standard practice to treat both acute and chronic pain and
      are options for pain management after RSE. Multiple studies exist showing ketamine to be both
      safe and effective for the treatment of acute pain, and to be as good as or better than
      opioids for this indication. The specific comparison of ketamine to fentanyl, however, has
      never been studied for the treatment of acute pain after rattlesnake envenomation in the
      United States. The investigators plan to measure pain scores after a single dose of ketamine
      or fentanyl in patients shortly after being envenomated, followed by continued treatment of
      pain guided by the treating doctor. There will be no restrictions on additional pain
      medications given and no other changes to the treatment of these patients during their
      hospitalization. This research is important because pain after RSE can be difficult to
      control and may require frequent, high doses of opioids for several days. An effective
      non-opioid medication would be helpful both to better-control pain and to reduce exposure to
      opioids in this patient population. This study will compare patient-reported pain scores
      after receiving a single dose of ketamine or fentanyl in patients with rattlesnake bites who
      have been admitted to the toxicology service at Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix
      (BUMCP).

      As clinicians, it is often a struggle to find effective pain control for a certain subgroup
      of patients with tetraplegia. These patients often have severe upper back, neck, and shoulder
      pain, limiting rehabilitation productivity and potential, and always limiting quality of
      life.

      This pain appears to be primarily musculoskeletal. Muscles in the upper back and neck become
      shortened, rock hard, and extremely tender with even the slightest touch or stretch.
      Refractory to multiple classes of medications, modalities, and other treatments, patients
      truly suffer-not only from pain, but from fatigue, sedation, expense, and loss of useful
      rehabilitation time due to attempted remedies. Unfortunately, this subgroup of patients is
      not small and the problem is significant, as anyone who specializes in the treatment of
      spinal cord injury patients will recognize.

      In search for another form of treatment, botulinum toxin A (BTXA) may be promising for pain
      control in that group of patients with tetraplegia whose pain has proven to be refractory to
      treatment. It did not take long searching the literature to find compelling evidence that
      BTXA may have another mechanism of action for direct pain control, apart from its well known
      mechanism for spasticity control. Clinically, it is increasingly being recommended and used
      for this purpose. In fact, one of the specific indications now recognized by most for BTXA
      treatment is for myogenic pain due to short, tight, strained muscles-just as we see with our
      population. Yet, it's application has not been studied in people with tetraplegia. Thus, the
      genesis of the project and the hope to help our patients evolved.

      Study hypotheses:

        -  In addition to traditional treatments used for pain control, injection of BTXA into
           cervical and upper back muscles will effectively reduce cervical/shoulder pain severity
           reported by individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries, regardless of the etiology
           of pain.

        -  Pain reduction secondary to the use of BTXA will be associated with a decrease in total
           analgesic medication use among SCI patients during acute inpatient rehabilitation.

        -  BTXA to treat cervical/shoulder pain will increase active participation in the
           rehabilitation program for individuals with tetraplegia during inpatient rehabilitation.

      Resistant hypertension (RH) is characterized by high blood pressure (BP) in spite of
      concurrent use of three or more antihypertensive agents of different classes, combined at
      optimal doses. Currently it has been largely discussed the influence of inflammation in RH.
      The BP variation promotes increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins 1 and 6. It was showed that treatment with TNF-α
      inhibitor improves BP and endothelial function, and reduces arterial stiffness in patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, it was demonstrated that TNF-α levels are increased in
      RH subjects compared to normotensives. This study aims to assess whether the acute inhibition

      Almost 50% of hypertensive patients remain uncontrolled. Clinical decisions are mostly based
      on office blood pressure,despite the fallacies of this method of measurement. Other reasons
      for not achieving blood pressure targets are lack of 24-hr efficacy and tolerability of
      existing anti-hypertensive drug classes. Aliskiren (Rasilez®) is a new antihypertensive drug,
      given once a day.

      The purpose of the REALITY study-[tREAtment of essentiaL hypertension with rasIlez.
      evaluation of different methods of blood pressure measurements - efficacy and safeTY
      evaluation -] is to evaluate the efficacy, and tolerability of aliskiren in a ""real life""
      setting. The efficacy of the drug will be evaluated using 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM). Results will be compared with office, nurse or self blood pressure
      monitoring. This comparison will allow to decide which follow-up technique is better for
      those hypertensive patients.

      In STEMI patients undergoing PPCI there is a delayed onset of action of oral P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitors, including prasugrel and ticagrelor. Crushing prasugrel and ticagrelor improves
      their PK and PD profiles as it favors drug absorption and onset of antiplatelet effects and
      because of this, it is commonly used in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI. However, despite the
      use of crushed tablets, up to one-third of patients may still have high on-treatment platelet
      reactivity (HPR) within the first 2 hours after loading dose (LD) administration of these
      oral agents. Cangrelor is a potent intravenous P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with rapid onset and
      offset of action associated with a greater reduction in ischemic events compared with
      clopidogrel in P2Y12 receptor naïve patients undergoing PCI. To date most studies have
      explored cangrelor in the setting of PCI subjects treated with clopidogrel. The PD effects of
      cangrelor in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI treated with a newer generation P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor and how this compares with a crushed formulation of the oral drug is unexplored.
      The aim of this prospective randomized study is to investigate the PD effects of cangrelor in
      STEMI patients undergoing PPCI treated with crushed ticagrelor.

      Antiplatelet therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of acute and chronic coronary
      artery disease. Aspirin was the first such therapy to prove its benefits in acute myocardial
      infarction. Compared to aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, a
      thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitor, has been demonstrated to reduce adverse event rates among
      patients with acute coronary syndromes (with or without ST-segment elevation) and those
      receiving intracoronary stents. In the Triton-TIMI 38 trial a novel thienopyridine,
      prasugrel, was compared to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Although prasugrel significantly reduced recurrent
      myocardial infarction, bleeding rates were increased and no improvement in cardiac or
      all-cause mortality was demonstrated. However, in 2009, the authors of the PLATO trial
      demonstrated an unexpected cardiovascular mortality benefit with ticagrelor over clopidogrel,
      an endpoint not previously met by any other antiplatelet agent against an active comparator.
      Based on the reproducible adverse events seen in the DISPERSE, DISPERSE-2, and PLATO trials,
      an adenosine-mediated effect of ticagrelor is proposed.

      Hypothesis: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor produces
      pharmacologic ischemic preconditioning, an undescribed potential off-label property of
      ticagrelor that could represent a plausible mechanism for its effects on cardiovascular
      mortality.

      The vast majority of births with sickle cell disease (SCD) occur in Africa and 90% are
      thought to die before the age of five. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only drug approved by the FDA
      for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. Although HU is used to treat small numbers of
      patients in Africa, cost, fear of toxicity, and lack of awareness and availability limit its
      use. The leukopenia that may be seen with HU raises the possibility of increased
      susceptibility to infection. Risk stratification - i.e., identification of patients most
      likely to benefit- could focus therapy and provide confidence that the risk:benefit ratio is
      favorable. Several clinical measures of future risk are well defined and findings on modifier
      genes in the US, primarily related to fetal hemoglobin (HbF), have further improved risk
      prediction. Whether the genetic variants predict severity in Africa is not known. The
      investigators have established a SCD cohort in Ibadan, Nigeria. In the first phase of this
      research the investigators will implement clinical risk examinations and assess the
      relationship between clinical characteristics (including levels of HbF) and known genetic
      markers. As a proxy for a birth cohort, the investigators will compare the frequency of the
      genetic markers in adult patients (i.e., ""survivors"") to children. In the second phase the
      investigators will randomize 40 high risk adult patients to fixed low dose HU or no HU
      treatment in a crossover design and monitor hematologic and physiologic parameters to
      document hematologic effects and safety. This work will lay the basis for a large-scale trial
      to document safety and efficacy.

      administration of ticagrelor in co-administration with aspirin, on restoring the blood flow
      in the occluded heart artery and improving the myocardial perfusion in patients suffering
      from myocardial infarction and planned to have a PCI. Patients can be randomised in either
      one of the 2 arms:

      re-hospital ticagrelor arm: Patients will receive a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor for the
      pre-hospital administration and placebo for in-hospital administration.

      Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR), the R-enantiomer of Lansoprazole, is an FDA approved
      drug (2009) for the management of erosive esophagitis and nonerosive reflux disease 1.
      Dexlansoprazole has a unique dual delayed-release delivery system designed to address unmet
      needs that may accompany traditional proton pump inhibitors, with two separate pH-depended
      release phases, the first in the proximal duodenum and the second in the more distal small
      intestine. This dual release system extends the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamics
      effects beyond those of single-release PPIs, allowing for dosing at any time of the day
      without regard to meals 1. A study conducted by Fass et al. has shown that the use of
      dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg in patients with symptomatic GERD is significantly more effective
      than placebo in improving nocturnal heartburn, reducing GERD-related sleep disturbances, and
      consequently improving work productivity, sleep quality and quality of life 2.

      Because of its pharmacokinetic properties, Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) may prove
      beneficial in optimizing the management of GERD and the associated burdens that often surface
      after the heavy evening and Suhur meals, such as increased nocturnal symptoms and poor sleep
      quality.

      Chronic fatigue (CF) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are disabling disorders that may be
      induced or aggravated by underlying sleep disturbances. The relationship between sleep

      quality on fatigue, a randomized controlled and cross-over trial with nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is carried out in patients who present with a primary
      complaint of chronic disabling fatigue and who are found to have an apnea-hypopnea index

      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that has reached epidemic proportions. In order to
      improve our strategies for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes the investigators need to
      better understand the mechanism of this disease, and the way in which current therapies, such
      as the drug liraglutide, work to control blood sugar. It is known that liraglutide acts via
      increasing the secretion of the hormone insulin from the pancreas, hormone that in turn
      controls blood sugar. However, it is not known whether liraglutide also has actions on the
      liver. Animal studies have suggested that liraglutide might act by controlling the liver
      enzyme glucokinase (GCK), an enzyme that increases blood sugar uptake by the liver. This
      could be a crucial mechanism in which liraglutide controls blood sugar independently of
      insulin, thus making it beneficial not only in type 2 but also in type 1 diabetes. The effect
      of liraglutide on GCK activity has not been yet measured in humans. The investigators propose
      to investigate the acute and chronic effect of liraglutide on GCK by using a simple, widely
      used procedure (an IntraVenous Glucose Tolerance Test-IVGTT) and a novel approach
      (mathematical modeling of data obtained from this procedure), to assess GCK activity in
      people with type 2 diabetes. The investigators will first compare data obtained form 2 IVGTTs
      (with and without liraglutide) performed 1 week apart (acute effect). The investigators will
      then give liraglutide to patients for 6 weeks and do another IVGTT to measure GCK activity
      (chronic effects). Data obtained from this study will be used to further understand the
      mechanism of liraglutide action and how to better employ our current therapeutic options and
      develop new strategies for preventing and treating diabetes.

      This research study will compare the treatment effects of three different asthma medications
      in asthma subjects whose asthma is well controlled when they take fluticasone, an inhaled
      corticosteroid. The treatments are fluticasone, montelukast (an anti?leukotriene drug), and a
      combination therapy of fluticasone and salmeterol (a long-acting beta-agonist). Fluticasone,
      montelukast, and the combination therapy of fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus®) are
      all approved for the treatment of asthma. We are looking at whether the three treatments are
      equally effective for reducing the number and the severity of asthma attacks in subjects with
      mild to moderately severe asthma.

      Foot ulcers represent a significant common complication in patients with diabetes. Wound
      healing is a challenge. Some wounds do not respond to the best practices in wound care.
      Considerable effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing.

      There are a variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human
      platelets are an autologous source of growth factors which probably can stimulate healing.
      Autologous platelet gel (APG) is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood.
      APG is rich in platelet growth factors. This study will investigate the potential improvement
      in wound healing with this material in diabetic foot ulcers.

      This study will compare the use of autologous platelet gel ( study group) and standard care (

      Several observational studies have shown improvement in episodic migraine with the use of
      greater occipital nerve block as an acute therapy, and a recent placebo controlled trial did
      not show a decrease in frequency of episodic or chronic migraine; however, there has never
      been a placebo controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of GONB as an acute treatment for
      headache, and there has been no determination of guidelines for selection of patients who
      would be most likely to respond to GONB. In light of the above, the investigators propose a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial examining the use of GONB with
      lidocaine/bupivocaine in patients with an acute episodic migraine. The results of this trial
      are expected to guide more appropriate therapeutic management of these participants and the
      optimal use of this procedure. 50 subjects will be entered into this study. This study is
      being conducted at Thomas Jefferson University only.

      Alcohol abuse and dependence are very prevalent and result in significant morbidity,
      mortality and cost to society (Harwood 2000). Pharmacotherapies to assist with alcohol
      dependence consist of disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate. Of these, acamprosate is unique
      in that it is not metabolized by the liver, but rather completely excreted renally. In
      contrast, naltrexone is metabolized by the CYP450 system of the liver and less than 2% is
      excreted unchanged and can cause liver damage (PDR 2005). Multiple cases of hepatitis,
      including both cholestatic and fulminant hepatitis, as well as hepatic failure resulting in
      transplantation or death, have been reported with administration of disulfiram (PDR 2005).
      The incidence of liver disease among alcoholics is high and increases with age and years of
      drinking and this may preclude the use of antabuse or naltrexone to help alcohol dependent
      patients with liver disease or that are elderly . Thus acamprosate has a unique safety
      profile that would make it ideally suited for treating alcohol dependence in the elderly,
      even in the presence of hepatic impairment. The current study is to evaluate the safety
      profile of acamprosate in elderly patients with alcohol dependence.

      Acamprosate, calcium acetyl homotaurinate, has been approved in most European countries and
      the U.S. for the maintenance of abstinence in recently detoxified alcoholics. The mechanism
      of action involves primarily the restoration of a normal N-methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor tone in glutamatergic systems (Rammes et al 2001). Several trials of acamprosate
      confirm its efficacy in the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol dependence (Lesch et al.
      2001; Slattery et al. 2003; Mann et al. 2004; Verheul et al. 2004). It also reduces the
      severity of relapse in alcoholics in abstinence based treatment programs (Chick et al. 2003).
      There is limited data on the safety of acamprosate in the elderly (PDR 2005).

      The Standard Care versus Celecoxib Outcome Trial (SCOT) is a large streamline safety study
      designed to compare the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib versus traditional non-selective
      Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) therapy.Traditional NSAID's are associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal toxicity. Cyclooxygenase 2
      (Cox-2)selective agents are associated with reduced upper gastrointestinal
      toxicity.Traditional NSAID's and Cox-2 inhibitors may also be associated with cardiovascular
      and renal disorders. Data from both randomised and observational studies suggest that
      celecoxib has similar or reduced cardiovascular toxicity when compared to traditional
      NSAID's. However, the overall safety balance of a strategy of celecoxib therapy versus a
      strategy of NSAID therapy is unknown. The European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) has
      requested that studies of the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib be carried out within the
      indicated population of Europe. This study addresses these issues by comparing the
      cardiovascular safety of celecoxib therapy with traditional NSAID therapy in the setting of
      the EU healthcare system.

      Heart failure (HF) is a disease that is caused by a reduced heart muscle function. Reduced
      heart muscle function can occur as a consequence of reduced pumping activity from a weak
      heart muscle or because of a stiff heart muscle. This study is looking at the effectiveness
      of Natrecor (nesiritide) in patients that require hospitalization due to worsening heart
      failure as a result of a stiff or thickened heart muscle. Natrecor is a man-made version of a
      protein that my body makes on its own and has been approved for the treatment of patients
      requiring hospital admission for heart failure and have shortness of breath at rest or with
      minimal activity.

      Natrecor has shown to lower the pressures in the heart and decreases the congestion in the
      lungs. This study is being done to see if the addition of a Natrecor to standard medical
      therapy for HF will improve symptoms faster or more completely than giving only the standard
      treatment for CHF.

      Immunoprophylaxis failure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) leading to vertical transmission remains
      a concern and has been reported in approximately 8-15% of infants born to hepatitis B e
      antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers with high levels of HBV DNA. Maternal HBV DNA > 6log10
      copies/mL (or >200,000 IU/mL) is the major risk for the mother-to-child transmission. Prior
      observational studies have shown that antiviral therapy including lamivudine or telbivudine
      use during late pregnancy can safely reduce the rate of vertical transmission in this special
      population compared to untreated patients.

      Tenofovir Disoproxil (TDF), a pregnancy category B medication, reduces HBV DNA and normalizes
      serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB) with few adverse
      effects. Two aspects on tenofovir use in pregnancy will be evaluated prospectively in this
      study:

      The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related complications is currently taking epidemic
      proportions. These complications increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease, which are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

      It is important to gain insight in the mechanisms underlying obesity-related complications,
      because this may lead to the development of directed therapeutic strategies.

      Currently, there is significant evidence that the cause of both insulin resistance and
      hypertension must be sought at the level of the microcirculation.

      Over activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a potential cause of
      microvascular dysfunction. Angiotensin II was indeed found to be implicated in the
      pathogenesis of obesity-associated hypertension and insulin resistance, possibly through
      interference with the vascular effects of insulin.

      Increased aldosterone levels have also been associated with resistant hypertension and
      insulin resistance, which is illustrated in patients with primary aldosteronism. Furthermore,
      aldosterone is known to exert several detrimental effects on the vasculature, some of which
      are offset by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

      In obese individuals, plasma aldosterone concentrations are increased as well. We hypothesize
      that increased aldosterone levels in adipose persons induce microvascular dysfunction, which
      contributes to the development of insulin resistance and hypertension, and mineralocorticoid
      receptor antagonism results in improved insulin sensitivity and decreased blood pressure by
      counteracting the adverse effects of aldosterone on the microvasculature.

      Neurogenic intermittent claudication is a specific symptom complex occurring in patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis. Characteristic of this disease is the occurrence of increasing leg,
      buttock or groin pain with or without lower back pain when walking a certain distance or
      reclining. Bending forward or sitting leads to a rapid pain relief. Lumbar spinal stenosis is
      defined as a reduction of the diameter of the spinal canal. The mechanism leading to stenosis
      is a remodeling and overgrowth of the spinal canal with osteophyte formation. Any loss of
      tissue or decrease of the disc height results in a relative laxity of the ligament structures
      and accelerates the degeneration of the spinal joints. As a therapy option, conservative
      therapy with oral analgesics and physical therapy is considered. This treatment can be
      intensified by adding epidural pain treatment. Is the conservative treatment not successful
      surgical intervention is necessary. In patients over 65 years of age operative decompression
      of the lumbar spinal stenosis constitutes the most common surgical operation of the spine. A
      relatively new therapy alternative is the interspinous process decompression (IPD). Studies
      have shown that the IPDs prevent narrowing of the spinal canal and neural foramens. The study
      is intended as a randomised, monocentre study to investigate the safety and the benefit of a
      minimally invasive percutaneous IPD-device in comparison with the best non-surgical operative
      treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

      Background:

      Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective arfa2-adrenergic agonist, is known to be a unique
      sedative agent which causes less acute tolerance, drug addiction and withdrawal compared with
      gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) agonists. Dexmedetomidine was approved for short-term ICU sedation
      in 2004 in Japan, and it has been used particularly for surgical ICU patients. In August 2010
      dexmedetomidine was approved in Japan for sedation lasting more than 24 hours.

      Recent evidence demonstrated that dexmedetomidine has organ protective effects including
      neuroprotection, cardioprotection, renal protection, gastrointestinal tract action, and
      anti-inflammatory action. Dexmedetomidine was shown to significantly decrease the infarct
      size in isolated rat hearts. Additionally, dexmedetomidine exhibited a preconditioning effect
      against ischemic injury in hippocampal slices, and this result was considered an apoptosis
      suppression effect of dexmedetomidine. Aydin C et al reported that dexmedetomidine enhanced
      the spontaneous contractions of the ileum in peritonitis rats compared with propofol and
      midazolam. Taniguchi and colleagues demonstrated that dexmedetomidine reduced high mortality
      rates and the plasma cytokine concentrations, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      in endotoxemic rats.

      A meta-analysis has shown that perioperative alfa2-adrenergic agonists, including
      dexmedetomidine infusion, decreased cardiovascular events on patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. Dexmedetomidine treated patients undergoing thoracotomy indicated increase in urine
      output, reduction in serum creatinine, and the suppression of diuretics in a randomized
      placebo-controlled double-blind study. Septic patients receiving dexmedetomidine had improved
      28-day mortality rates compared with septic patients receiving lorazepam in a sub-group
      analysis of MENDS randomized controlled trial.

      These positive effects of dexmedetomidine on the cardiovascular system, neurons, kidneys,
      gastrointestinal tract action, and an anti-inflammatory action, are expected to improve
      mortality in septic patients. However, large clinical research studies have not been
      conducted yet. We designed and conducted the DESIRE trial (DExmedetomidine for Sepsis in ICU
      Randomized Evaluation trial) to test a hypothesis that dexmedetomidine may improve clinical
      outcome and has these organ protective effects on septic patients.

      Objective:

      To determine whether dexmedetomidine improves clinical outcome and has organ protective
      effects on septic patients.

      Currently, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in oocyte donors is performed by daily

      stimulation day until ovulation induction with a bolus of another injection of a
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) Agonist. Injections of the GnRH Antagonist avoid

      aspiration. There is a preparation of long-acting recombinant follicle stimulating hormone
      (rFSH= (corifollitropin alfa (FSH-CTP), Elonva®, MSD), that allows that a single subcutaneous

      It is well known that X-ray contrast media can affect kidney function in some patients,
      especially when administered intra-arterially, and patients who already suffer from reduced
      kidney function and diabetes mellitus may be at increased risk. It is widely accepted to use
      low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast media, especially in patients at risk for contrast
      media-induced nephropathy. However, little is known about the intravenous use of X-ray
      contrast media in risk patients, such as contrast-enhanced CT examinations. The main purpose
      of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects on kidney function of two contrast
      media, the iso-osmolar iodixanol and the low-osmolar iopamidol in patients at risk of kidney
      damage associated with the injection of contrast media. Due to the iso-osmolar feature, it is
      expected less influence on renal function following administration of iodixanol. A standard
      hydration procedure, based on available guidelines will be given to all patients to prevent
      negative effects on the kidneys. Serum creatinine (SCr ) concentrations will be measured
      before and up to 7 days after contrast media administration to evaluate the effects on renal
      function.

      Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries in trauma patients. These fractures are
      associated with significant pain as well as decreased ability to inspire deeply or cough to
      clear secretions, which together lead to complications of the lungs and breathing which leads
      to risks of further injury and even death.

      One recent study found that the ability to move air into and out of the lungs practically
      doubled with the administration of a single-injection Erector Spainae Plane Block (ESPB)
      while pain levels nearly halved. However, a single-injection nerve block lasts less than 24
      hours while a perineural local anesthetic infusion (also termed a ""continuous peripheral
      nerve block"") may be administered for multiple days. This entails inserting a tiny tube
      through the skin and into the area around the nerves, after which more local anesthetic may
      be administered prolonging the numbing effects.

      The possibility of extending the duration of a ESPB with local anesthetic administration via
      a perineural catheter has not be investigated. We therefore are conducting a randomized,
      triple-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study to investigate the addition of a
      continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB following traumatic rib fractures.

      The primary outcome of this study will be the maximum inspired volume measured by incentive
      spirometry on the afternoon following the nerve block procedure. We hypothesize that the
      maximum inspired volume will be significantly increased in the afternoon following the
      procedure with the addition of a continuous ESPB to a single-injection ESPB.

      Patients who receive renal transplantation at Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH) are placed on
      triple maintenance immunosuppression, which means that patients take 3 types of
      immunosuppression drugs to suppress their immune system including tacrolimus, mycophenolate
      (MPA), and prednisone. However, due to the effects of MPA on the gastrointestinal tract,
      patients often complain of GI adverse effects. Current practice is to either dose-reduce MPA
      or convert the patient to an alternative agent, typically Azathioprine. Both of these
      strategies have limitations, largely due to concerns related to efficacy. Everolimus (EVR)
      has demonstrated similar efficacy to MPA in renal transplantation and may offer a benefit
      related to GI adverse effects, so the investigators will convert patients to EVR in this
      study. Patients who are within their first year post-transplant will be converted to EVR upon
      enrollment in the study, and serial measurements ,or a series of measurements looking for an
      increase or decrease over time, of GI adverse effects will be conducted over 1 year

      Asthma is most effectively treated by delivering inhaled drugs from an inhaler (puffer)
      directly into the lungs. Inhaled steroids are used in asthmatic patients to dampen down lung
      inflammation, which unchecked, can often lead to patient symptoms. Inhalers deliver a mist
      containing particles of lots of different sizes (like hairsprays). Medical puffers used by
      patients produce a 'coarse' mist of drug particles, which have the potential for side
      effects, as different sized particles will reach different parts of the airways and include;
      the mouth, the throat, the windpipe, and the bloodstream (all places we do not want the
      inhaled drug to go - and can give rise to important side effects)and, the lungs (where we do
      want the drug to 'deposit').

      Our aim in this study is to test an inhaled steroid by giving it to subjects as a 'fine' mist
      containing drug particles of nearly all one size using a research nebuliser (a Spinning Top
      Aerosol Generator). We shall use small, intermediate and large drug particle mists. We aim to
      find out how much of the drug goes to the blood stream for each particle mist and compare it
      with the standard puffers used in routine clinical practice.

      We hope this study will provide information to the rationale that by improving the efficiency
      of drug delivery (by changing drug particle size) one may improve inhaled drug delivery and
      ultimately, clinical patient benefit.

      Botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) prevents the release of acetylcholine in presynaptic terminals of
      the neuromuscular junction. It has been proposed to be effective in spastic conditions of the
      head and neck including oromandibular dystonias, bruxism, and muscular hypertrophy (1,2,3,4).
      However, only one randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial has been completed
      involving 20 patients demonstrating both objective and subjective improvement in the BTX-A
      treated group over those treated with saline at one week, one month, and six months (5).

      Currently, in most orofacial pain practices, when the diagnosis of masticatory myofascial
      pain in the head region is made, patients are treated with a standard myofascial protocol.
      This protocol involves stretching, application of moist heat, spray and stretch, and
      lidocaine trigger point injections into the masticatory muscles. This is considered the
      standard of care among most orofacial pain practioners.

      There have been no randomized, double-blinded, head-to-head trials comparing BTX-A injections
      to lidocaine injections in the treatment of masticatory myofacial pain. Moreover, in all
      studies, muscles were targeted using surface landmarks with no confirmatory tests to
      guarantee the medication was administered to the intended muscle. In previous studies, the
      medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, important masticatory muscles that is often hyperactive
      in masticatory myofacial pain was not injected due to lack of palpable surface landmarks.
      Ultrasound and electromyography (EMG) guidance will help us locate these muscles.

      The purpose of this study is to objectively measure functional improvement in patients with
      masticatory myofascial pain injected with lidocaine versus BTX-A. A pilot study enrolling 20
      patients is proposed. 20 patients will be randomized to receive either BTX-A or lidocaine
      injections into the bilateral temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoid.
      Objective and subjective clinical parameters will be measured. These include pain at rest and
      with chewing, maximum non-assisted and assisted mouth opening, protrusive and laterotrusive
      jaw movements, subjective efficacy of treatment, and side-effects of treatment. Patients will
      be assessed at baseline, one week, one month, and three months after the procedure.

           patients with schizophrenia showed an increase in the anticipation-related functional
           MRI signal. This suggested that amisulpride could affect the brain structures and that
           responses to amisulpride could be associated by the brain structures as seen previous
           studies about treatment response to antipsychotics and brain structures. But to date, no

      All participants should have a follow-up visit within 7-14 days of hospital discharge. Heart
      rate and systolic blood pressure will be assessed at this clinical visit. For participants
      randomized to predischarge initiation of ivabradine and on ivabradine 5mg BID, the heart rate
      may be used to adjust the dose the dose to 2.5mg BID or 7.5mg BID. For participants
      randomized to usual care, ivabradine may be initiated at the provider's discretion. All
      participants will have a second follow-up study visit 6 weeks (42 +/- 14 days)
      post-discharge. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (KCCQ and PGA) will
      be assessed. For participants already taking ivabradine in either treatment group, the heart
      rate may again be used to adjust the dose of ivabradine. For participants not yet receiving
      ivabradine, it may be initiated at the provider's discretion. All participants will receive a
      90 (+/-7) day post-discharge phone call by site to assess for event status and tolerability
      of ivabradine. All participants will have a final study visit at 180 (+/-14) days
      post-discharge. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (Kansas City
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and Patient Global Assessment) will be assessed. The attending
      physician may initiate ivabradine per usual care clinical practice.

      The primary hypothesis of the PRIME-HF study is that, compared with usual care, a treatment
      strategy of initiation of ivabradine prior to discharge for a hospitalization with acute HF
      will be associated with a greater proportion of participants using ivabradine at 180 days.
      Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of predischarge initiation of ivabradine
      on:Heart Rate (Change in heart rate from baseline to 180 days and Median heart rate at 180
      days) and Patient-Centered Outcomes (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and
      Patient Global Assessment (PGA)). Tertiary objectives will be to explore the impact of
      predischarge initiation of ivabradine on other assessments of evidence-based implementation
      of ivabradine and beta-blockers at 180 days. Evaluations will incorporate data based on
      whether or not indication status was retained and whether or not an ivabradine prescription
      was provided. Tolerability of ivabradine and adverse events during study follow-up.

      The aim of the study is to learn more about the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) and to evaluate the mechanisms responsible of the action and benefits of ticagrelor.

      Ticagrelor is an oral and reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 receptor. Few information is
      available about the action of ticagrelor on the molecules involved in thrombogenesis and
      platelets activation in ACS.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the mechanisms of ticagrelor action in vivo.

      It was observed that patients with myocardial infarction have higher blood levels of
      microparticles than patients with unstable angina or stable angina.

      The investigators assumed that ticagrelor benefits are represented by a reduction of
      microparticle levels, a marker of endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular
      disease, and by a modification in microRNAs pattern, fragments of mRNA that have a regulatory
      action in various cellular processes (such as proliferation, differentiation, growth and
      cellular death) and represent new biomarkers in ACS.

      An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality executive summary indicated that better
      comparative effectiveness trial designs are needed to determine the relative merits of
      existing versus new and expensive biologic drug therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      There are now 9 biologic therapies approved for treating RA. Four classes of biologics (TNF
      antagonists, B-cell inhibitors, T-cell co-stimulator blocker, and Interleukin-6 receptor
      blocker) are approved for use in RA patients with moderate or severe disease activity.
      Several critical questions have arisen, such as 1) what therapy should be prescribed after
      failure of methotrexate and/or other oral disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to
      adequately control disease activity; 2) what is the level of efficacy of the various biologic
      therapies when compared in head-to-head trials; and 3) what are the mechanisms associated
      with failure of methotrexate and/or other oral DMARD therapy and responsiveness to biologic
      therapies. The MAZERATI study will provide the foundation for answering these questions and
      determining the mechanisms associated with these biologic therapies.

      Despite the wide-spread use of botulinum toxin (BT) to treat spasticity (increased muscle
      tone) in central neurological disease, evidence-based guidance on dosing, dilution, and
      injection technique is limited. The wide-spread use of BT in spasticity management, expense
      of these agents, and detrimental impact from movement into non-injected muscles mandates a
      better understanding of BT movement within muscles. A proof-of-concept paper written by
      investigators at Weill Cornell Medicine introduced a non-invasive MRI approach with ""voxel
      thresholds"" that was able to detect intramuscular effects of BT at 2 and 3 months
      post-injection of BT. The purpose of the current set of studies is to refine this MRI
      technique to better visualize the movement of botulinum toxin through muscle. In addition,
      the investigators plan to explore, using the imaging technique, how spastic muscle and
      differing dilutions affect BT movement in an effort to support the development of better
      research techniques to study toxin movement in human muscle.

      - Rationale: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been shown to reduce plasma
      glucose levels to a further extent when added to standard therapy in type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Given the well-known beneficial effects of GLP-1 analogues on glucose metabolism by
      stimulating insulin release, suppressing elevated glucagon levels, delaying gastric emptying
      and reducing food intake, it is anticipated that liraglutide developed by Novo Nordisk
      (Victoza®) also has beneficial effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus as has been proven by
      several trials. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with obesity and sedentary lifestyle.
      Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (EE) over a period of time. It
      has been presumed that activity energy expenditure and daily energy expenditure are lower in
      most people in Western societies. Increasing non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT),
      defined as all energy expended due to everyday activity, exclusive of volitional exercise,
      may be an effective way to maintain daily EE and combat overweight and obesity. One way to
      promote NEAT is to decrease the amount of time spent on sedentary behaviors (e.g. watching
      television).

      This leads us to hypothesize that adding NEAT to GLP-1 analogues in type 2 diabetes has an
      additive effect on glucose regulation, weight control and blood pressure. On the other hand,
      we hypothesize that a decrease in HbA1c, weight and blood pressure could add to an improved
      quality of life and less health care costs. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is
      to determine the synergistic effect of liraglutide and activating lifestyle by increasing
      NEAT on glucose metabolism and weight. First line therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      currently consists of lifestyle changes with metformin. When failure of this regime occurs,
      sulfonylurea derivates and/or thiazolidinediones can be added. One third of patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus fail with this regimen after 5 years of monotherapy, and nowadays
      GLP-1 analogues can be added to prevent deterioration of glycaemic control. However,
      comparison of this strategy with NEAT has not been performed and the synergistic effect of
      combination of GLP-1 with increasing NEAT has not been investigated. Treatment with GLP-1
      analogues in combination with NEAT could theoretically overcome all shortcomings of current
      treatment strategies of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Thanks to rapid reendothelialization derived from the pro-healing property of the EPC capture
      stent, 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended after EPC capture stent
      implantation. Shorter maintenance of dual antiplatelet therapy might minimize the risk for
      stent thrombosis in cases of discontinuation of antiplatelet regimen and prevent wasteful
      medications and bleeding complications related with dual antiplatelet therapy. Thus, the EPC
      capture stent might be valuable for the elderly because they are vulnerable to premature
      discontinuation of DAPT.

      On the other hand, statin upstream therapy has gained popularity because it seems to reduce
      periprocedural myocardial injury especially in ACS through its pleiotrophic effect like
      plaque stabilization. However, the benefit of pretreatment of statin in patients with stable
      angina remains controversial. It is reported that statin administration could increase EPC
      level by accelerated differentiation towards the endothelial progenitor lineage.

      We hypothesize that the EPC capture stent with 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy is
      non-inferior to DES in the elderly subjects with stable coronary artery disease. To test this
      hypothesis, we will perform a multi-center, randomized, prospective trial aimed at
      demonstrating the efficacy and safety of the EPC capture stent with 1-month DATP versus EES
      with standard 12-month DAPT in elderly patients with stable coronary occlusive disease in
      real world practice.

      symptoms can often be multifactorial.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) need to frequently undergo courses of IV antibiotic
      therapy. To avoid a high number of venipunctures peripheral venous catheters (SPVC) or
      cannulas are used. Because of the irritant action of the drugs used, SPVC's often do not last
      for the whole antibiotic course (usually of two weeks) and the patient has to be punctured
      again for the insertion of a new IV line. With the passing of time the veins are more
      difficult to be found. An alternative to the use of a cannulas is the surgical insertion of a
      central venous catheter. This intervention may have contraindications or, specially in
      adolescents, cause unacceptable alterations of the body image.

      The aim of this study is to find a way to prolong the duration of the SPVC used by CF
      patients during antibiotic courses avoiding the irritation of the vein or a phlebitis.

      Design of the study: randomized controlled trial. The study will see a collaboration of
      nurses, physicians and technicians of the Tuscan CF Centre.

      The patients that will participate at the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      groups: one group will receive the antibiotics prescribed according to the maximal dilution
      suggested by the pharmaceutical company, the other will receive a much higher dilution (i.e.
      a higher volume of Normal Saline), but the time of administration will be the same.

      The assessment will regard: the level of inflammation of the vein (with a special visual
      scale) and the duration of the SPVC.

      The hypothesis that is to be proved is that diluting the antibiotic in a higher volume of
      Normal Saline it is possible to delay or prevent the irritation of the vein and the onset of
      a phlebitis.

      In case that the hypothesis will be confirmed by this study an easy, secure, low cost and
      immediately available system will be available to reduce the number of venipunctures
      necessary to complete a course of IV antibiotics.

      Anaemia in dialysis patients requires treatment with frequent dose adjustments. There are two
      current possible treatments for anaemia which are iron and erythropoietin stimulating agents
      (ESA). Dosages of these medications are currently guided by a patient's ferritin levels and
      haemoglobin, but these markers are known to be inaccurate. The current clinical protocol
      therefore tends towards overuse of both agents which can be associated with toxicity, and the
      reliance on these markers prevents retrospective assessment of treatment responsiveness. This
      study is designed to investigate the factors which predict which agent would produce a better
      response. Patients with a fall in haemoglobin will be given treatment with either iron or an
      increased dose of ESA as they are currently, but allocated at random rather than by poorly
      performing biochemical markers. The iron treated and ESA treated groups can then be analysed

      walking ability in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD the arteries
      (blood vessels) in the legs are narrowed because of the build up of plaque. The leg muscle
      can hurt in patients with PAD and this is usually described as a cramp or tiredness. This
      pain is called intermittent claudication. Metformin is an FDA approved medication for the
      treatment of diabetes. The investigators believe that Metformin may help your leg muscles

      The dimethyl fumarate is an oral drug, indicated in the treatment of the relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (MS) , which efficacy and safety has been assessed and validated in two
      randomised, placebo phase-controlled III international studies, organized by the
      pharmaceutical company developing the molecule. TECFIDERA® (dimethyl-fumarate) has received
      European approval on January 30, 2014, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing
      remitting MS.

      Treatment with dimethyl fumarate is introduced as part of the usual care under supervision of
      a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease.

      It has proved effective to reduce the number of relapses in patients with recurring-remitting
      MS and reduce the number of patients who have relapses during treatment.

      The objective of the study is to observe, in real conditions, on the one hand the tolerance
      and the other evolution, clinical and radiologic disease in patients already treated by
      dimethyl-fumarate and collect long-term safety data.

      The TRACK [Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Comorbidities with Kineret
      (anakinra)]-study: a randomized, open-label multicenter study assessing the efficacy of
      anakinra in lowering HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) as well as changes in DAS28 in Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (R.A.) patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) Authors: R. Giacomelli,(A,B) P. Cipriani
      (A) and P. Ruscitti (A) on behalf of the TRACK study-group; (A) University of L'Aquila,
      L'Aquila, Italy; Background: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pivotal role in R.A., joint erosion
      and cartilage destruction.(1) Anakinra (a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1
      receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which blocks the activity of both IL-1α and IL-1β) has shown in
      a number of RCTs (2-6) to be effective in the treatment of R.A., in monotherapy,(2,4) as well
      as associated to methotrexate (MTX).(3,5,6) IL-1β plays also an important role in the
      pathogenesis of T2D: Glucose has been shown to induce IL-1β hypersecretion through
      inflammasome activation, while IL-1β induces impairment of β-cell secretory function and
      β-cell apoptosis.(7) In prediabetic subjects, the expression of IL-1Ra is induced by IL-1β
      and reflects the body's response to counterbalance increased IL-1β activity.(7) Levels of
      IL-1Ra tend to rise up to 6 years before the diagnosis of T2D.(8,9) IL-1Ra has been
      successfully used as a marker for the risk of developing T2D in subjects with metabolic
      syndrome.(10) As a clinical proof of concept, IL-1 inhibition with anakinra in patients with
      T2D has shown to improve the secretorial function of beta-cells as well as to lower the ratio
      of proinsulin/insulin and glycated hemoglobin/hemoglobin significantly, favoring glycemic
      control and possibly reducing the severity and prevalence of the associated complications of
      this disease.(11) Summarizing, IL-1 inhibition with anakinra has a clinical impact on R.A. as
      well as T2D. As from 6-10% of Italian R.A. patients have also T2D, this trial aims at
      investigating the impact of IL-1 inhibition on both diseases. Very recent data also show that
      T2D is a predictor of response to anakinra-treatment in R.A. patients,(12) which furthermore
      justifies the use of anakinra in this subset of R.A. patients. Objectives: [Primary] To
      evaluate the change in HbA1c between baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and at last follow
      up of 2 years from the beginning; [Secondary] To evaluate the efficacy on controlling signs &
      symptoms of R.A., assessing the remission rate at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and at follow up
      (2 years), using the evaluation scale of disease activity on 28 joints, DAS28 and SDAI
      improvements from baseline conditions over time points, according to EULAR response criteria.
      Methods: 200 patients in 28 Italian centers with active R.A. refractory to treatment with
      methotrexate and T2D will be enrolled and randomized to receive either 100mg of anakinra once
      daily by subcutaneous injection or any anti-TNF-alfa drug treatment. [84 subjects will be
      required in each treatment arm to reach 90% power with an alpha error of 0.05 to detect a
      mean difference between the study arms of 0.25 percentage points of HbA1c . The assumed
      difference of HbA1c is rather conservative when compared to previously published changes in
      T2D patients (11).] Anti-diabetic treatment is required to be unchanged for at least one
      month prior to enrolment. Patients will be invited to maintain dietary habits and lifestyle
      during the study period. Further details can be viewed on the trials website after
      subscription.(13) References: (1) Arend & Dayer, Adv. Imm. 1993; 54: 167-227. (2) Bresnihan,

      This study is being conducted to determine if smoking will influence the platelet aggregation
      inhibition ability of clopidogrel and prasugrel. It will also determine if smoking has any
      effect on the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of prasugrel and the active and
      inactive metabolites of clopidogrel.

      The primary hypothesis is that smoking status will influence the antiplatelet effects and
      active metabolite concentrations of clopidogrel but will have no impact on prasugrel's
      antiplatelet effects or active metabolite concentrations.

      Hepatitis C infects as many as 300,000 Canadians. Up to 25% of those infected will develop
      cirrhosis and be at risk for liver failure and liver cancer. Cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C
      is the most common reason for liver transplantation in Canada. The largest group of infected
      people are those who use injectable street drugs. However, people who continue to use drugs
      are routinely excluded from scientific studies testing new treatments for Hepatitis C and are
      generally recommended not to receive available treatments. Although several reasons are given
      to justify excluding these people from treatment, little scientific evidence is available to
      support it. We plan to examine how successful treatment with the current standard treatment
      of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is in those who continue to use injection drugs. We

      local) reformed drug users). Our goal is to determine whether reasonable success rates can be

It results in a loss of somatic sensory sensation across multiple unilateral dermatomes due to local anesthetic mediated blockade of the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerve roots. It is increasingly being used due to ease of placing the block and a perception of greater safety. It has been shown to provide pain relief from rib fractures, thoracotomy, and chronic neuropathic pain of the chest wall. However, to date, erector spinae plane block has not been compared with paravertebral block in regards to analgesia with mastectomy surgery, which has been extensively studied.', 'Paravertebral block is a classic regional anesthesia technique that has been in use for over 100 years. It is performed by the injection of local anesthetic into the space between the costotransverse ligament and parietal pleura resulting in blockade of ipsilateral intercostal nerves.

      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) occurs when arteries become narrowed or hardened because of
      a build-up of plaque or fat deposits. PAD develops most often in arteries in the legs, which
      can result in reduced blood flow to the legs and feet, occasionally causing leg pain and
      fatigue. Early identification of PAD and treatment with lifestyle changes or medications can
      help to keep legs healthy and lower risk for heart attack and stroke, but endovascular or
      surgical procedures may be necessary for people with severe PAD. Even after endovascular
      intervention, PAD symptoms must be continually monitored to prevent the development and
      progression of blockages in the arteries. The best approach for monitoring symptoms is still
      undetermined. This study will compare the effectiveness of an intensive combination of lipid
      modifying medications versus standard lipid modifying medications in treating people with
      significant PAD who have had an endovascular intervention.

      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can suffer from infertility because they do not
      produce an egg each month, resulting in irregular periods. As a result, these women often
      need a medication called clomiphene citrate (clomiphene) to induce ovulation. A traditional
      'clomiphene protocol' begins with a short course of progestin treatment to bring on a period
      (termed a 'withdrawal bleed') before starting the clomiphene medication. Newer evidence,
      however, has suggested that this progestin-induced shedding of the uterine lining (i.e.,
      withdrawal bleed) may decrease the chances of pregnancy. The purpose of our study is to
      determine whether withdrawal bleeding has an impact on pregnancy rates for patients with PCOS
      undergoing a clomiphene cycle.

      It is hypothesized that patients who undergo ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate
      without prior endometrial shedding will have higher clinical pregnancy rates than those who
      begin with a progestin-induced withdrawal bleed.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) on the neural
      and behavioral subcomponents of self-control, that is cognitive control and reward
      functioning, in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

      The investigators hypothesize that LDX is associated with 1a) decreased task-independent
      locus coeruleus (LC) activity; 1b) increased task-related activity in LC and the cognitive
      control network; 2) increased LC connectivity with the cognitive control network and 3)
      improved task performance and self-control. The investigators will test their hypotheses on
      fMRI data with linear contrasts of voxel-wise maps of parameter estimates (in both univariate
      and connectivity analyses).

      The investigators will also assess change in brain activity with the LDX in the LC and
      ventral tegmental areas (VTA) as we hypothesize that they are altered in ADHD and related to
      cognitive control and self-control dysfunction in ADHD.

      The investigators will use a repeated-measures, between-subject design to compare the effects
      of oral once daily LDX in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial (RCT) on neural
      (fMRI) and behavioral correlates of cognitive control via a working memory and a reward -
      delay discounting task in adolescents and young adults.

      A new condition has been added which will use a within-subject comparison, cross-over design
      between a single dose of LDX versus a single dose of placebo.

      with this trial and total subject participation duration of 7-8 weeks. The screening phase
      will include an initial screening visit and a screening PSG night. After successful
      screening, subjects will complete a baseline PSG night and undergo a third PSG night to
      monitor initial safety and compliance with study drug at a dosage of 4.5 g/day of sodium
      oxybate. Thus the subject will undergo three consecutive nights of PSG in the sleep center.

      B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. Despite
      enhancement of childhood B-ALL outcome, relapses remain difficult to treat. Several studies
      in adult acute myeloid leukaemia have shown that proliferation of immunosuppressive cells
      -particularly T regulatory (Treg) cells and deficient natural killer (NK) cells- was
      associated with poor response to chemotherapy. However, few studies have been done on
      childhood ALL and none on relapse of B-ALL. Moreover, a newly described immunosuppressive B
      cells subset (Breg cells) seems to have a role in oncogenesis in mice model, but its
      significance has never been evaluated in human cancers. The purpose of this study is to
      prospectively evaluate the immune status of children newly diagnosed with first relapse of
      B-cell ALL, and to compare results with those of children treated for B-ALL in complete
      remission. Classic lymphocytic phenotype, proportions of immunosuppressive cells (Treg cells,
      deficient NK cells, Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and/or Programmed T cell
      death 1) and thymopoiesis will be evaluated. The investigators assume that increase of
      immunosuppressive cells proportions could be associated with B-ALL relapse.

      agents (eg, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones). Although GLP-1 analogs and DPP-4 inhibitor
      medications are effective, there are differences between these products, including method of

      Patients are being asked to be part of this study because they are a liver transplant
      recipient and have the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Current routine treatment for HCV for liver
      transplant patients includes taking two medications called pegylated interferon alfa-2a
      (Pegasys®) and ribavirin. Patients Pegasys and ribavirin are FDA approved for the treatment
      of HCV.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding a third drug called telaprevir for
      the experimental treatment of HCV in liver transplant patients. The combination of Pegasys,
      ribavirin and telaprevir is currently FDA approved for the treatment of HCV, but is
      specifically not FDA approved for HCV patients who have had a liver transplant. This is
      because more information is needed about possible drug interactions between telaprevir and
      cyclosporine, or telaprevir and tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive drugs, which are typically
      part of routine care for transplant patients.

      Studies have shown that the addition of telaprevir greatly increases the efficacy of Pegasys
      and ribavirin for the treatment of HCV. However, these studies did not include adequate
      information on transplant patients due to the potential drug interactions.

      The investigators hope to gather more information about the safety and efficacy of telaprevir
      given in combination with Pegasys and ribavirin in the liver transplant patients who have HCV
      that is not well controlled with Pegasys and ribavirin alone.

      Diabetes is more likely to occur during pregnancy. When present only in pregnancy it is
      called gestational diabetes, and it places both mom and baby at risk for complications.
      Glyburide is one of the currently used treatments for diabetes during pregnancy. This drug is
      a medication taken by mouth that decreases sugar levels in the blood. It is known to decrease
      the risk of complications linked to diabetes in pregnancy. Recent studies in pregnancy have
      described a difference in the way and how well the drug works compared to when used outside
      of pregnancy.

      Oral blood sugar lowering agents are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      lower blood sugar in non-pregnant subjects with diabetes. No oral (taken by mouth)
      blood-sugar lowering agents are FDA approved for use in pregnancy. Although Glyburide is not
      FDA approved for this use, it is the most commonly used oral blood sugar lowering agent in
      pregnancy.

      This research study will help us learn more about the variations in blood sugar levels in
      women with diabetes in pregnancy who are taking glyburide and how changes in the timing of
      when the glyburide is taken would affect blood glucose levels. The goals of this study are:

        -  To learn the effect of changing the time between glyburide doses on glucose levels

      European Authorities in venous thromboembolic event prevention after major orthopaedic

      Recent studies show that BCG vaccination reduces neonatal mortality by more than 40%. This
      effect cannot be explained by prevention of tuberculosis, which is very rare among infants.
      The protective effect of BCG vaccination is seen already within the first week. It seems that
      BCG provides a non-specific beneficial immune modulation - thereby reducing overall
      mortality. Mortality is very high among newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care
      unit. If BCG has immediate beneficial effects on the immune system, vaccinating children with
      BCG as early as possible may save lives. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a
      randomized trial among newborns in Guinea-Bissau, randomizing newborns admitted to the
      neonatal intensive care unit at the National Hospital 1:1 to BCG immediately or at discharge
      (usual practice).

      non-Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) patients with Type 2 Diabetes with exenatide alone or in
      combination with basal insulin as compared to treatment with basal bolus insulin alone. The
      association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes is

      will compare the efficacy and safety of exenatide alone or in combination with basal insulin
      to control high blood glucose levels resulting in a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

      The obesity epidemic has resulted in an exponential increase in obesity-related disorders
      including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The associated morbidity
      and mortality have major consequences both at an individual as well as on the socioeconomical
      level. Thus, the development of novel therapies aimed at reducing the development of obesity
      is highly warranted. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) recently emerged as a novel player in energy
      expenditure in humans as it combusts fatty acids towards heat. Interestingly, obese subjects
      have less BAT as compared to lean subjects and activation of BAT by means of intermittent
      cold exposure reduces fat mass. Therefore, BAT is considered a promising novel target to
      reduce obesity and associated disorders. As cold exposure is not the most desired therapeutic
      strategy for humans, current pre-clinical research focuses on pharmacological activation of
      BAT.

      Interestingly, the investigators have recently shown that central agonism of the receptor for
      the incretin hormone glucacon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) results in activation of BAT in mice.
      One of the currently used anti-diabetic drugs that enhances GLP-1 availability is Sitagliptin
      (STG). Interestingly, STG also reduces body weight and plasma triglyceride (TG) levels in
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. The mechanism underlying these beneficial metabolic
      effects is currently unknown. The investigators hypothesize that STG enhances BAT activation,
      thereby increasing energy expenditure and combustion of TG-derived fatty acids, resulting in
      lowering of plasma TG levels and body weight.

      To this end, the investigators will perform a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled
      study in which 30 male Dutch Caucasian adults aged 35-50 years with moderate obesity and
      pre-diabetes are included. Subjects will be treated for 12 weeks with STG or placebo. Before
      and after treatment, the investigators will determine BAT volume and total BAT activity via
      cold-induced 18F-FDG PET-CT scans, resting energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry using
      ventilated hoods, body weight, and body composition via DEXA scan. Furthermore, before and
      after treatment, blood samples will be taken to measure plasma lipids, glucose and insulin
      levels.

      This study will offer valuable novel insight in the effects of pharmacological activation of
      BAT in human obese subjects.

             with 'clamp' techniques that are intensive. HOMA is also used routinely to assess

             representative of decreased insulin sensitivity. Although insulin secretion is
             pulsatile, the correlation between HOMA computed from repeat sampling (using a mean of
             three samples taken at 5-minute intervals to compute HOMA) and the value obtained from
             a single basal sample to determine insulin sensitivity has been shown to be near

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of leptospermum scoparium honey as a type of
      dressing and/or debridement agent on stage III or IV pressure ulcers has an increased
      efficacy and safety compared to the current treatment protocol that includes the use of
      hydrogel/Vaseline, collagenase, and silver alginate dressings as the standard of care.
      Utilizing a non-inferiority trial, it is expected that the use of leptospermum scoparium as a
      treatment for Stage III and Stage IV pressure ulcers will not be inferior to the comparison
      treatment of standard of care wound dressings. Moreover, this research design will enable the
      research team to determine if the honey based dressings are equivalent to or superior to the
      comparison treatment.

      Therefore, the investigators specific study objectives are as follows:

        1. Primary Objectives: Determine if the use of honey as an alternative treatment will
           reduce site inflammation/irritation and pain associated with pressure ulcers compared to
           the standard treatment options. Specifically, the investigators will monitor patient
           PUSH scores, Braden Risk Scale scores, granulation and/or epithelial tissue progression,
           length of time to heal, patient pain assessments via the Wong Baker Face or Numeric
           Scale, wound odors, and incidence of adverse events (measured by allergies, stinging
           sensations, bacterial infections that warrant antibiotic intervention, etc.).

        2. Secondary Objective: Patients in the honey treatment group will have lower costs per
           healed ulcer than patients in the standard collagenase treatment group.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Symptomatic therapy is
      primarily aimed at restoring dopamine function in the brain. Oral selegiline in conjunction
      with L-dopa has been a mainstay of therapy for PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations
      for many years. The mechanisms accounting for selegiline's beneficial adjunctive action in
      the treatment of PD are not fully understood. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B
      (MAO-B) activity is generally considered to be of primary importance.

      Oral selegiline has low bio-availability and is typically dosed BID, for a total of 5-10 mg
      daily. Recently, the FDA approved a new orally disintegration tablet (ODT) formulation of
      selegiline, called ZelaparTM. This new formulation utilizes Zydis technology to dissolve in
      the mouth, with absorption through the oral mucosa, thereby largely bypassing the gut and
      avoiding first pass hepatic metabolism. This allows more active drug to be delivered at a
      lower dose. Consequently, Zelapar is dosed once-daily, up to 2.5 mg per day. There are no
      empirical data indicating whether the use of the new approved formulation of selegiline ODT
      (Zelapar) is superior or preferred by patients compared to traditional oral selegiline. It is
      believed that clinical efficacy will be preserved or enhanced, by delivering more active
      drug, with improved patient preference for the ODT formulation due to the once-daily dosing .

      The effectiveness of orally disintegrating selegiline as an adjunct to carbidopa/levodopa in
      the treatment of PD was established in a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial
      (n=140; 94 received orally disintegrating selegiline, 46 received placebo) of three months'
      duration. Patients randomized to orally disintegrating selegiline received a daily dose of
      1.25 mg for the first 6 weeks and a daily dose of 2.5 mg for the last 6 weeks. Patients were
      all treated with levodopa and could additionally have been on dopamine agonists,
      anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination of these during the trial. At 12 weeks,
      orally disintegrating selegiline-treated patients had an average of 2.2 hours per day less
      ""OFF"" time compared to baseline. Placebo treated patients had 0.6 hours per day less ""OFF""
      time compared to baseline. These differences were significant (p < 0.001). Adverse events
      were very similar between drug and placebo.

      Trachoma is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness. This disease, caused by
      Chlamydia trachomatis, is endemic in many parts of the developing world. In 1990s we
      evaluated the use of community-wide treatment with oral azithromycin in a project called
      Azithromycin in Control of Trachoma (ACT). This approach resulted in clinical improvement and
      dramatic reduction in prevalence of chlamydial infection through a 1-year follow-up. We
      enrolled the ACT villages, as well as an additional village that had not had any prior
      treatments, in our ACT II (2005) study and performed clinical surveys to assess trachoma
      activity testing conjunctival swabs for the presence of C. trachomatis by nucleic acid
      amplification tests (NAATs). Thus, we hoped to determine the long-term (10 year) effects of
      azithromycin treatment.

      We have completed the census and clinical survey of the initial three villages. Mass
      treatment with azithromycin would not be justified with such low rates (1.8 - 4%) of ocular
      chlamydial infection. We have treated only those living in households with one or more cases
      of chlamydial infection and we will not follow up on these individually treated families.

      In order to achieve the goals of our study, we now propose to identify other more remote
      villages with trachoma infection rates of 20% or more to evaluate the effect of
      community-wide treatment with single dose of oral azithromycin. If one or more of these
      villages (dependent upon population) has trachoma rates of 20% or more they will be invited
      to participate in the azithromycin treatment. In one set of subjects (1 or 2 villages,
      dependent upon population and infection rate) we will perform treatment, and follow them up
      at 2-, 12-, and 24-months post-treatment to ascertain infection rates. In a second set of
      subjects (1 or 2 villages, dependent upon population and infection rate) we will perform
      treatment, then perform re-treatment at 30-days post initial treatment, and follow them up at
      2-, 12-, and 24-months post-treatment to ascertain infection rates. This should help us
      determine the need for/and the best time for re-treatment to eliminate blinding trachoma, as
      some recent studies suggest there is a 2-4% failure rate in the initial treatment. In sum,
      this study should provide a rational approach to use of community-wide azithromycin treatment
      to eliminate blinding trachoma as a public health problem

      High-dose vitamin A to children above 6 months of age reduces all-cause mortality by 23-30%.
      The WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation (VAS) with the first vaccine after 6 months of
      age. However, the effect of providing VAS with vaccines has never been investigated. We have
      hypothesised that the effect of VAS depends on the immune stimulus at the time of
      supplementation. Hence, the effect might vary depending on which type of vaccine it is given
      with. In particular, we hypothesised that VAS might be beneficial when given with measles
      vaccine but not when given with DTP vaccine. Normally the first vaccine after 6 months of age
      would be a measles vaccine, but many children come late for their DTP vaccinations and
      receive DTP alone or together with measles vaccine. Hence, it is important to study whether
      the effect of VAS is the same irrespective of the vaccine(s) administered at the same time.

      Guinea-Bissau has not yet implemented the WHO vitamin A policy of providing VAS with
      vaccines, but plans to do so within the next years. Together with the Ministry of Health in
      Guinea-Bissau, the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau will investigate the effect
      on mortality and morbidity of implementing the WHO vitamin A policy in Guinea-Bissau. This
      will be done in a large randomised trial.

      BHP has a demographic surveillance system (DSS) which has followed a population of now more
      than 150,000 individuals for almost 30 years. Children will be randomised to receive VAS or
      placebo with their first vaccine after 6 months of age, and will be followed through the DSS
      to assess mortality and morbidity. Based on previous observations, the effects of VAS might
      differ according to sex and season. The interaction between VAS, sex, and season will also be
      studied in the present trial. By identifying situations where VAS may be beneficial,
      ineffective, or even harmful the study may contribute importantly to optimising the VAS
      policy for low-income countries.

      This study investigates the prevention of early mortality in patients initiating
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa where 79% of the co-infected cases of TB
      reside. Many published studies have shown a surprisingly high proportion of all patients
      initiated on ART dying within 6 months (8-26%) with increasing risk with decreasing CD4 T
      cell count. The majority (median 70%) occur in the first 3 months with the greatest
      proportion of deaths due to previously undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB). The investigators will
      enroll patients from 4 geographically diverse countries (Gabon, Mozambique, South Africa, and
      Uganda) in a randomized open label clinical trial targeting a population of people with high
      mortality risk; patients with CD4 T cell count < 50 cells/μl and body mass index (BMI) < 18
      kg/m2. Severely immunocompromised patients with low BMI in the intervention arm will receive
      presumptive anti-TB 4-drug chemotherapy and subsequently initiate ART within 2 weeks compared
      to ART alone. The main objective is to measure and compare early mortality in the group
      presumptively treated for TB in addition to ART. Other sub-objectives are to determine the
      predictors of early mortality and the causes of death by autopsy (traditional and verbal), to
      determine if presumptive anti-TB treatment affects viral suppression with ART, and to assess
      incidence rates and characterize drug toxicity in patients dually treated. Because of the
      high rates of TB co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa in the HIV-infected, the investigators
      expect that patients presumptively treated for TB in addition to HIV will have a lower
      mortality rate than patients receiving ART only. This trial is expected to be of great public
      health benefit and generalisability.

      With the advent of measures to try to decrease the incidence of transfusion-related acute
      lung injury (TRALI), the Blood Bank industry is attempting to avoid collection of plasma from
      female donors who have been pregnant in order to reduce the transfusion of plasma that may
      contain HLA antibodies. This has led to a decrease in the number of donors available for the
      production of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Per Blood Bank regulatory standards in the United
      States, FFP must be frozen within 8 hours of collection. Plasma that is frozen within 24
      hours of collection is called FP24, and it is produced when whole blood cannot be processed
      within the 8-hour time period for the generation of FFP. Studies of coagulation factors in
      FFP and FP24 have shown that coagulation factor activities are adequate to maintain
      hemostasis in both products. Many hospitals are using FFP and FP24 interchangeably in adults,
      and occasional hospitals are using these products interchangeably in neonates. However,
      studies concerning the use of FP24 in neonates have not been performed.

      The investigators propose a single center prospective pilot study comparing the clinical
      efficacy of FFP vs. FP24 in 50 nonsurgical neonates and babies up to age 6 months requiring
      plasma for an International Normalization Ratio (INR) of 1.5 or more.

      This protocol describes a pilot study to compare the use of FFP with FP24 in nonsurgical
      neonates. Use of plasma in these cases is mostly for patients with perinatal hypoxia or
      necrotizing enterocolitis and an INR of 1.5 or more. Transfusion of plasma (10 to 15 ml/kg)
      is performed for these patients approximately every 8, 12, or 24 hours, as deemed indicated
      by the patient's clinicians, and monitored with prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin
      time (PTT), and INR.

      The recommended antiplatelet treatment regimen for patients affected by acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) consists in the
      combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. More potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors,
      such as ticagrelor, have been developed which are associated with less response variability
      than clopidogrel and better clinical outcomes. Ticagrelor use has increased significantly
      because of its more expanded Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications compared with
      prasugrel. However, despite the evidence for sustained efficacy and safety, many physicians
      limit treatment duration with ticagrelor to the early phases following an ACS mostly due to
      cost issues and concerns about increased bleeding. Therefore, it is very common in clinical
      practice to switch patients while on maintenance dosing (MD) with ticagrelor to treatment
      with clopidogrel. However, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of switching from ticagrelor to

      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is considered the most effective treatment for severe
      treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), but it requires about 3 weeks of
      treatments and can cause considerable acute deficits in memory. It would be a major advance

      of memory problems. Ketamine is an excellent candidate for augmentation of ECT because of its
      acute effects on depression, its short half-life, and its safety profile when given at low

      Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of mild to moderate infections, including prostate infections. It has been
      suggested that antibiotic treatment influences PSA levels due to the fact that an increase in
      PSA levels may be caused by inflammation or swelling of the prostate. Antibiotics are used to
      treat such inflammatory conditions. However, it has not been proven that antibiotics can be
      used to lower PSA. This research is being done to see if treatment with the antibiotic
      Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride affects the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test. This
      study may also help doctors in deciding which patients need a prostate biopsy.

      Basal arthritis of the thumb is a common condition with increased prevalence in
      post-menopausal women, obese persons, and the elderly. Surgical options are varied and
      efficacious, but not all patients are candidates for surgery. The successes and pitfalls of
      previous, similar trials are carefully considered in the creation of our own. Though steroid
      injection is the standard of care in basal joint arthritis, current data does not support its
      efficacy beyond placebo effect. No trial has yet examined the efficacy of botulinum toxin
      type A (BTX-A) injection into the basal thumb joint nor compared it to steroid. Since
      efficacy of steroid is questionable at best, our hope is that BTX-A injection of the basal
      joint might be the next great tool in treating this common, debilitating disease.

      The OSTEOVUE™ Spine Dissector is a new ultrasonic energy device, specifically designed for
      soft tissue removal from vertebral surfaces. The aim of the present study is to compare blood
      loss in multilevel PSF surgeries in patients with adolescent scoliosis (idiopathic or
      neuromuscular) done with ED or with UD. Blood loss will be estimated by major intraoperative
      surgical Stage (1 and 2) and postoperatively (until discharge). Additionally, the study will
      assess the possible influence of the device use in secondary perioperative outcomes.

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
      HIVinfected individuals. The precise mechanisms underlying this increased cardiovascular risk
      remain to be elucidated. Platelet hyperreactivity and increased platelet-monocyte aggregation
      (PMA) are found in HIVinfectedpatients and may contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk
      as platelets play a key role in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis and in acute
      cardiovascular events. In addition, HIV-infected individuals frequently suffer from
      persistent immune activation and inflammation. In a crosssectional study the investigators
      recently showed that individuals using a regimen containing the integrase inhibitor
      raltegravir have reduced platelet hyperreactivity and PMA compared to other antiretroviral
      regimens. Other recent studies showed that raltegravir is associated with decreased immune
      activation. Due to the inherent limitations of cross sectional studies, the investigators aim
      to expand our findings in an intervention study. The investigators will conduct a randomized
      control trial where the investigators switch patients to a integrase containing treatment
      regimen to assay possible changes in platelet function and persistent immune activation.
      Knowledge gathered in the proposed study can help understand and prevent cardiovascular
      disease in patients treated for a HIV infection by reducing platelet hyperreactivity and
      persistent immune activation.

      High blood glucose levels in surgical patients with diabetes are associated with increased
      risk of medical complications and death. Improved glucose control with insulin injections may
      improve clinical outcome and prevent some of the hospital complications. In patients who have
      undergone surgery, high blood glucose increases the risk of wound infection, kidney failure
      and death. It is not known; however, what is the best insulin regimen in patients who will
      undergo surgery. The use of repeated injections of regular insulin is commonly used for
      glucose control in hospitalized patients with diabetes. Recently, the combination of Lantus®
      and Apidra® insulins has been shown to improve glucose control with lower rate of
      hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). We hypothesize that in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted
      to general surgery wards, treatment with once daily glargine (Lantus) plus supplemental
      glulisine insulin (Apidra®) will produce better glycemic control and a lower rate of hospital
      complications than treatment with regular insulin per sliding scale (SSRI). The present study
      aims to determine which insulin treatment is best for glucose control in hospitalized
      patients with diabetes. Glargine and glulisine insulins are approved for use in the treatment
      of patients with diabetes by the FDA.

      Subjects included in the study will have type 2 diabetes and be admitted to Grady Memorial
      Hospital, Veterans Administration Medical Center, and Emory University Hospital, Atlanta,
      Georgia. A total of ~94 patients will be recruited at each institution.

      A post-hoc cost analysis of hospitalization costs and charges of the Rabbit surgery trial
      will be completed in order to determine differences in hospitalization cost between basal
      bolus insulin and SSI regimen.

      Nowadays features for the diagnosis of delirium are:

        1. Disturbance of consciousness (i.e. reduced clarity of environment awareness) with
           reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention;

        2. A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or
           the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a
           pre-existing or evolving dementia;

        3. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and its
           severity fluctuates during the course of the day;

        4. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that
           the disorder is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a general medical
           condition, substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.

      Treatment of underlying clinical disease is important to remit the delirium. However, these
      procedures alone are not enough to remit the delirium early and to prevent sequels. There is
      a need for a specific and faster strategy to treat the delirium.

      Facial fractures make up a significant proportion of injuries in trauma patients. Treatment
      of these fractures often results in standard surgical interventions. While up to the early
      1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery was controversial, its
      efficacy is well accepted today. Chole and his team could show that the administration of
      antibiotics one hour preoperatively and eight hours after the intervention reduces the
      incidence of infectious complications in facial fractures from 42,2% to 8.9%. However there
      is still no consensus about the duration of the postoperative administration. In literature
      postoperative prophylaxis in facial fractures varies from single-shot 6-7 up to a duration of
      7 and even ten days postoperatively 8-10. The use of antibiotics can be associated with
      allergic or toxic reactions, adverse effects, drug interactions and increasing bacterial
      resistance. In addition some authors assume that a prolonged administration of antibiotics
      might increase the risk of infectious complications via superinfection. On the other hand a
      short term or single shot administration might not be enough to prevent the onset of an
      postoperative infection. Up to date there is no standard to support the administration of
      antibiotics after surgical repair of a facial fracture.

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized double-blinded trial is to investigate the
      utility of antibiotics administered in the postoperative period after surgical revision of
      facial fractures.

      Hypothesis: a short-term antibiotic prophylaxis of 1 day postoperatively is equally effective
      as a long-term administration of 5 days in facial fractures.

                       definition:

             Asthma is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased responsiveness of the airways
             to a variety of stimuli. The major symptoms of asthma are episodes of dyspnea,
             wheezing, and cough, which may vary from mild and almost undetectable to severe and
             unremitting (status asthmaticus). The primary physiological manifestation of this
             hyperresponsiveness is variable airway obstruction. This can take the form of
             spontaneous fluctuations in the severity of obstruction, substantial improvements in
             the severity of obstruction following bronchodilators or corticosteroids, or increased
             obstruction caused by drugs or other stimuli [American Thoracic Society, 1987].

               1. Asthma Medication History: A subject must be using a low to medium dose of an ICS
                  (Table 1) OR a combination of controller medications (Table 2), containing a low
                  (total daily) dose ICS (as defined in Table 1) for at least 4 weeks preceding
                  screening.

      Non cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is defined as recurring, angina-like, retrosternal chest pain
      of non cardiac origin. Annual prevalence of NCCP in the general population of the western
      world ranges from 25-35%. Of those patients presenting to an emergency room with chest pain,
      a cardiac etiology is ultimately found in only 11-39%. Several conditions are associated with
      NCCP, with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) being the most prevalent, constituting up
      to 60% of cases. However, NCCP is considered a disorder of heterogenous nature and several
      other conditions, apart of GERD, such as esophageal dysmotility and esophageal
      hypersensitivity have been implicated.

      Treatment of NCCP remains a real challenge due to the diverse underlying mechanisms
      responsible for patients' symptoms. Given the fact that GERD is by far the most common
      etiology, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been tried extensively; however, after 6
      weeks of treatment complete resolution of symptoms occurs in only 30% of patients, the
      optimal duration of PPI administration is not known, while the best maintenance dose has
      never been determined. Although the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) could theoretically benefit those patients with esophageal hypersensitivity, the
      trials that have been published so far have included small number of patients and reported
      conflicting results, while the co-administration of PPIs with SSRIs has not been evaluated so
      far. Furthermore, data on treatment of patients with functional chest pain are lacking.

      Polycystic ovary occurs in 15-20% of the population will be submitted to TRA. Whether it is
      associated with other signs or symptoms (polycystic ovarian syndrome) as if presented in
      isolation, its therapeutic management has special connotations sometimes favoring the low
      response although the standard is the tendency to hyperresponsiveness.

      Although there are studies comparing the combination of FSH and LH and FSH in controlled
      hyperstimulation of these patients, there are no previous prospective randomized studies
      comparing administration of urinary FSH (hFSH-HP) with a combination of FSH and HCG (HMG HP).

      Therefore the aim of this study is to prove that both drugs are comparable in the treatment
      of these patients. The test substances are marketed in Spain (Fostipur and Meriofert,
      respectively) with an indication for use in these patients. In this study both medicines will
      be administered in a randomized way under the usual conditions in which it is used in routine
      clinical practice to compare the quantity of mature oocytes respect to the total oocytes
      obtained, as a primary outcome measure.

      This research study is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate if taking diuretics
      (medications that increase urine production and help with fluid removal from the body) in a
      standardized fashion (using a guideline for adjusting doses based on measured urine output)
      could improve health outcomes in patients with cardiorenal failure or cardiorenal syndrome
      (combined heart and kidney failure) with edema (too much fluid in their arms, legs, and/or
      lungs). Under usual care, these patients are treated with diuretics and other medications in
      increasing doses, but not necessarily to maintain a specific amount of urine output per day.
      Current heart failure (HF) treatment guidelines do not provide any standard protocol, or
      guideline, for adjusting diuretic doses. At the point when kidney function worsens to the
      degree that the kidneys are no longer able to respond to the medications used to remove
      fluid, either ultrafiltration (UF) or dialysis (also called hemodialysis [HD]) is typically
      started in order to remove fluid. In both UF and dialysis, excess fluid is removed from the
      body by using a machine. In dialysis, both waste products and fluid are removed and
      electrolyte abnormalities are corrected. In UF, only fluid is removed. Both procedures use
      the same machine. This study will test whether a Protocolized Diuretic Strategy (ProDiuS), a
      plan for adjusting diuretic doses based on measured urine output, will improve clinical care
      for cardiorenal syndrome. Such a plan for adjusting diuretic doses is needed to improve
      symptoms, decrease the length of hospital stays and rehospitalization rates, and improve
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in cardiorenal syndrome patients.

      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) include Autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome and Pervasive
      Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). These are developmental disorders
      beginning prior to three years of age. Recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates
      suggest that ASD affects up to 1 in 100 individuals and up to 1 in 50 boys. There are very
      substantial costs associated with caring for patients with ASD, and ASD has the highest
      Caregiver Burden Scores of any condition. There are three core symptom domains of ASD,
      including social deficits, repetitive behaviors and language deficits. Patients can also have
      associated symptoms of attentional deficits, disruptive behaviors and intellectual
      disability. There is currently no Food and Drug administration (FDA) approved treatment for
      the core symptoms of autism, but risperidone and aripiprazole have FDA approval for
      disruptive behaviors associated with autism.

      Taken together the results from DAPT and PEGASUS-TIMI54, it appears that physicians may
      consider extending beyond 1 year or reinitiating treatment with a thienopyridine or
      ticagrelor 60mg bid in patients with a prior MI and features of high ischemic and low
      bleeding risk. Comparative clinical or pharmacodynamic studies, however, between prasugrel 5
      mg od and ticagrelor 60 mg bid in the chronic phase of stable post MI patients have not been
      performed.

      In light of this, we believe that a dedicated pharmacodynamic study of ticagrelor 60 bid mg
      vs prasugrel 5 mg od in a PEGASUS-like population would be informative for the practicing
      clinician, thus setting the rationale for conducting this specifically designed

      Dry eye is the most common reason for visit to an ophthalmologist's office. The prevalence is
      on the rise and is mainly attributed to factors such as increased environmental pollution and
      contact lens use. The current management options are limited to over the counter artificial
      tear drops and three FDA-approved drugs. Of these, cyclosporine has been used worldwide for
      treating mild to moderate dry eyes. The earlier version consisted of 0.05% cyclosporine which
      worked well for a limited number of inflammatory dry eye conditions. Recently, 0.09%
      cyclosporine was approved by the FDA. The nearly double concentration is expected to be more
      beneficial for severe inflammation which is often seen in Sjögren syndrome and other
      Rheumatological conditions associated with dry eyes. In this pilot project, the investigator

      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a histologically defined glomerulonephritis (renal biopsy) by the
      presence of deposits immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the renal mesangium (at least 1+) by
      immunofluorescence. The clinic allows excluding secondary forms (10-15%). Recurrence of this
      condition on the renal graft is time-dependent and confirmed in 25 to 50% of 10 years
      post-transplant.

      The primary immunosuppressive induction regimens currently used in kidney transplantation are
      the anti-lymphocyte globulin (GAL) whose main target is human T lymphocytes (ATG, polyclonal)
      and monoclonal anti-CD25 antibodies (α chain of the interleukin receptor 2 in the surface of
      T lymphocytes). Due to their potent and prolonged immunosuppressive properties, the ATG may
      prevent or delay the recurrence on renal transplant.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of induction therapy (ATG versus
      Basiliximab) in the cumulative incidence at 5 years of (IgAN) recurrence after a first kidney
      transplant.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open trial with a follow-up period of 5 years
      old.

      Patients in the ATG arm will receive 5 antilymphocyte globulin infusions Fresenius® (rabbit
      immunoglobulin antilymphocyte human T-Fresenius® said ATG) from Day 0 to Day + 4
      post-transplant (day 0 one dose of 4mg / kg, day 1 one dose of 4mg/kg, day2 one dose of
      4mgkg, day 3 one dose of 3 m/kg and day 4 and one final dose of 3 mg/kg) and the patients in
      the anti-CD25 arm will receive 2 doses of 20 mg of basiliximab (Simulect®) pn day 0 and day 4
      after the graft. The maintenance immunosuppressive therapy is left to the discretion of the
      center.

      The primary endpoint will be the clinical and histological recurrence of IgAN defined by the
      presence of mesangial deposits of IgA (at least 1) by immunofluorescence on a biopsy of the
      graft triggered by the onset of proteinuria 1g/j and/or microalbuminuria greater than 300 mg

      The most important prognostic indicator for the breast cancer patient is the axillary lymph
      node status. With the introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, many women were spared
      the morbidity of a full axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) while having the axillary nodes
      assessed with a low false negative rate. Approximately 30% of women who undergo ALND
      experience shoulder/arm morbidity including numbness, pain, weakness and decreased range of
      motion. In addition, the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) held the promise that women
      with early stage breast cancer would be able to avoid the dreaded morbidity associated with
      axillary lymph node dissections including lymphedema, decreased range of motion and pain.
      Since the adoption of SLN, numerous papers have documented that SLN is superior to ALND.
      However, patients who undergo SLN still have a significant amount of pain with this
      procedure. There are few published studies which objectively assess the subjective and
      objective symptoms of SLND.

      Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      fractures and spinal fusion, relief of pain in acute sprains and whiplash injuries,
      improvement of skin blood flow, healing of venous stasis ulcers, and reduction of
      postmastectomy lymphedema. Indeed, radiofrequency PEMF devices are FDA approved for pain and
      edema relief. PEMF devices are economical and disposable, and can be incorporated
      unobtrusively in standard post-op dressings. We have recently reported, in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study on breast reduction, that post-op PEMF therapy produced a
      significant decrease in pain and pain medication use, along with a concomitant decrease in
      IL1-beta in the wound bed.1 The current pilot study will be designed to determine if PEMF
      treatment, given in addition to standard of care, can reduce post-operative discomfort and
      morbidity after lumpectomy and SLND, or lumpectomy and ALND. Lumpectomy and ALND/SLND
      patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study will undergo standard
      surgery, but will be randomized to one of two groups: the treatment group with a PEMF coil
      placed around the arm and the control group with a coil that delivers no PMF. We expect
      postoperative pain to be reduced in the PEMF-treated patients as well as improved arm
      mobility and strength. The use of PEMF might reduce the need for narcotic pain medications
      and their side effects of sedation, nausea, and vomiting. It may also reduce costs related to
      arm morbidity.

      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children. A short (3-5 day) course of a
      short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care
      for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in
      the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the
      advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency
      departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients
      have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to
      confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to
      give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second
      dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been
      done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring
      hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as
      four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is
      an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18
      hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone.

      Our goal is to determine if a change in therapy to one containing Kaletra can improve the
      immune response in patients who have previously been immune partial responders or
      non-responders. We also are interested in knowing if this agent improves immune response by
      affecting cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) + T cell death (apoptosis) or by further
      inhibiting (preventing) ongoing, low-level, viral replication to levels below detection by
      current viral load measurements. This will help us understand why immune responses to
      effective antiretroviral therapy are so different and help determine some possible guidelines
      for managing patients with poor immune responses.

      Hypothesis: Patients with poor immune responses to HAART who receive Kaletra in place of
      their current PI or Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) while continuing
      their current 2 NRTI backbone will have improved immune response to therapy compared to
      patients who continue their current regimen.

      Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is thought to affect approximately 8% of men aged 18 and
      older. Patients with this condition experience pain in the perineum, the genitalia, and the
      rectum. As well, there is associated voiding, sexual, and ejaculatory dysfunction. The impact
      of patient well-being is thought to be equivalent to patients with congestive heart failure.
      The etiology of this condition is unknown, thus making treatment very difficult. Researchers
      have pursued an infectious cause for the disease; however, studies have failed to
      substantiate this theory. Despite this, the main treatment offered to patients is long-term
      antibiotic therapy. Results from this treatment modality have been unsatisfactory.

      Other groups have postulated that the symptoms of CPPS may be secondary to neuromuscular
      factors. Some studies have demonstrated increases in pelvic muscular tone. Maneuvers such as
      prostate massage and levator massage have shown some benefit in relieving symptoms. Treatment
      with alpha-blockers to relax prostate smooth muscle has brought about improvement in a
      portion of patients. Use of generalized muscle relaxants has produced mediocre results.

      However, many of these neuromuscular treatments are generalized and do not target the
      perineal musculature directly. It is theorized that spasm of the perineal muscles triggered
      by an unknown noxious stimuli (e.g. infection) cause the pain and symptoms of CPPS. At our
      center, we have performed pilot studies using botulinum toxin A. Four patients were treated
      with Botox"". 100 U were injected in three locations in the midline of the bulbocavernosus
      muscle. The bulbocavernosus muscle is easily accessible and shares innervation with the
      pelvic musculature. Patient's response to medication was measured by the NIH Prostatitis pain
      scale and as well as the University of Washington prostatitis pain scale. All patients
      reported resolution of symptoms. Remission lasted for duration of 10-12 weeks. No patients
      reported adverse events.

      Botulinum toxin A is effective in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the
      control or treatment group, with equal allocation using block randomization. The primary null
      hypothesis is that a combination sufentanil and buprenorphine based pain control regimen will
      not result in lower morphine equivalent requirements for pain control when compared to a
      classic fentanyl and hydromorphone based regimen. The secondary working hypothesis is that
      the patient satisfaction survey mean satisfaction scores will be higher in the buprenorphine
      and sufentanil treated group when compared to the classic fentanyl and hydropmorphone treated

      will not be significantly different in the buprenorphine and sufentanil treated group when

      The aim of this study is to compare two licensed asthma inhalers and to then evaluate the
      safety of reducing treatment when patient's asthma is in control. The inhalers used in this
      study are the Seretide® 250 Evohaler®, which is widely used in UK, and a recently licensed
      inhaler called Flutiform®. National guidelines recommend that asthma medication should be
      increased when patients are experiencing worsening of their asthma, and reduced when asthma
      is in control. However, it is likely that in daily clinical practice some patients are
      over-treated. It is therefore necessary to conduct more studies which demonstrate that
      reducing treatment dosage can be done safely.

      This study has two phases. In the first phase the investigators aim to recruit 224 patients
      through approximately 40 clinics in the UK and Ireland. One third of these patients will be
      selected in random to use the high dosage Seretide® 250 Evohaler® and two thirds will use
      high dose Flutiform® 250 inhaler for 12 weeks. At the end of phase 1 the investigators will
      compare how well asthma was controlled between the two groups.

      After phase 1 those patients who used Flutiform and did not have any problems with their
      asthma can participate in phase 2. In phase 2 half of the patients will stay on high dosage
      Flutiform 250 and half will be switched to the medium dosage Flutiform 125 inhaler. At the
      end of phase 2 the investigators will compare asthma control between the two groups.

      This study will be conducted by Research in Real Life Ltd (Cambridge, UK) with partial
      funding from Napp Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The estimated total duration of the study is 18 months
      and each patient will spend a maximum of 6 months in the study.

      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major health problem in children, effecting up to 20% of
      young children. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is also reported to be prevalent in
      children. Several large epidemiologic studies support an association between HP infection and
      lower iron stores. Other small studies suggest improvement in anemia following HP treatment.

      We assume that the prevalence of HP infection in Israeli children diagnosed with IDA is high
      and that that adding therapy for HP in those children will improve the response to iron
      deficiency.

      This study will investigate the use of a drug called Gastrografin to aid in bowel mobility
      for paediatric patients who have undergone gastroschisis surgery. Gastroschisis is an
      abdominal wall birth defect where the bowel protrudes through a small opening beside the
      umbilicus. In these patients, the bowel is often less mobile due to its exposure outside of
      the body during fetal development. It is common for the bowel to be swollen and matted, which
      decreases motility and makes it increasingly difficult for the baby to have normal bowel
      function. Administering Gastrografin facilitates the entry of water into the intestines and
      bowel, which is thought to aid in bowel function and motility. This study will compare
      gastroschisis patients who received Gastrografin to gastroschisis patients collected as part
      of an ongoing observational study at our centre who did not receive Gastrografin.
